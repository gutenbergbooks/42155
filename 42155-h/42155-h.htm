<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRST ARRIVAL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose they shouldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, when I wuz out in Colorady, in a
place we called Devil&rsquo;s Pass, I gut a grizzly
backed up agin&rsquo; a ledge one day &rsquo;n&rsquo; heving ony
one bullet &rsquo;twas a case uv me or him, as yer
might say. My pardner, Simon Gurthy,
who likewise didn&rsquo;t hev no bullets, &rsquo;count uv
bein&rsquo; stripped b&rsquo; the Injins, he says, &lsquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo;
ye don&rsquo;t fetch him.&rsquo; &rsquo;N&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; I
do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeb Rushmore, with methodical accuracy,
spat at a sapling near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo; asked his listener.</p>
<p>Jeb spat again with leisurely deliberation.
&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; I did,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You always hit, don&rsquo;t you, Jeb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purty near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy edged along the log on which they
were sitting and looked up admiringly into
the wrinkled, weatherbeaten face. A smile
which did not altogether penetrate through
the drooping gray mustache was visible
enough in the twinkling eyes and drew the
wrinkles about them like sun rays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The boy was satisfied for he had absolute
confidence that his companion could not make
a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> hit him&mdash;I mean
fetched him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, wot yer <i>got</i> to do, yer do. When I
told General Custer onct that we&rsquo;d get picked
off like cherries offen a tree if we tried rushin&rsquo;
a pack uv Sioux that was in ambush, he says,
&lsquo;Jeb, mebbe it cain&rsquo;t be done, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo;,
but jest the same, we <i>got</i> ter do it.&rsquo; Some on
us got dropped, but we done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did General Custer call you by your first
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same&rsquo;s you do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>This was too much for the little fellow.
&ldquo;Gee, it must have been great to have General
Custer call you by your first name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now, I ben thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;twas purty fine
this winter hevin&rsquo; <i>yew</i> call me by my fust
name, &rsquo;n&rsquo; keep me comp&rsquo;ny here. We&rsquo;ve got
ter be close pards, me an&rsquo; you, hain&rsquo;t we,
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m almost sorry they&rsquo;re coming&mdash;kind
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were certainly coming&mdash;&ldquo;in chunks,&rdquo;
as Roy Blakeley would have said, and before
night the camp would be a veritable beehive.
All summer troops would be coming and going,
but just now the opening rush was at
hand, and the exodus from eastern towns and
cities, following the closing of schools, would
go far to fill the camp even to its generous capacity
before this Saturday&rsquo;s sun had set.</p>
<p>The Bridgeboro Troop, from the home town
of the camp&rsquo;s generous founder, Mr. John
Temple, would arrive sometime in the afternoon
&ldquo;with bells on&rdquo; according to the post
card which little Raymond Hollister had
brought up from the post office the day before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>They were cruising up the Hudson to Catskill
Landing in their cabin launch, the <i>Good
Turn</i>, and would hike it up through Leeds to
camp. The card was postmarked Poughkeepsie,
and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">Desert Island of Poughkeepsie,</span>
<span class="jr">Longitude 23, Latitude 40-11.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Put in here for gasoline and ice-cream
soda. Natives friendly. Heavy gales.
Raining in sheets and pillow-cases. Mutiny
on board. Pee-wee Harris, N. G.
Mariner, put in irons for stealing peanuts
from galley. Boarded by pirates below
Peekskill. Coming north with bells on.
Reach camp Saturday late. All&rsquo;s well
with a yo-heave-ho, my lads.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like Roy Blakeley,&rdquo; Raymond
had said to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does sound kinder like his nonsense,&rdquo; the
camp manager had answered.</p>
<p>All through the long winter months Raymond
had lived at the big camp with no other
companion than Jeb Rushmore. They had
made their headquarters in Jeb&rsquo;s cabin, the
other cabins and the big pavilion being shut
tight. Raymond had often thought how like
the pictures of Valley Forge this vacant clearing
in the woods looked in its covering of snow,
and sometimes when Jeb was busy writing letters
(it was a terrible job for Jeb to write
letters) the little fellow had been lonesome,
but he had gained in weight, he had slept like a
bear, he had ceased entirely to cough, and he
ate&mdash;there is no way to describe how he ate!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>In short, a great fight had been fought out
in the lonely camp that winter, and little Raymond
Hollister had won it. He could trudge
into the village and back without minding it
now and he could raise the big flag with one
hand. Just the coming summer to top off
with and he would be well.</p>
<p>Raymond lived down the Hudson a ways
and he had come to Temple Camp with his
troop the previous summer. His patrol
leader, Garry Everson, had won the Silver
Cross, which, according to the rule of the
Camp, entitled him and his companions to remain
three extra weeks, and when Mr. John
Temple had heard of Raymond&rsquo;s ill health
from the Bridgeboro boys on their return
from camp, he had called his stenographer
and sent a couple of home-runs over the plate
in the form of two letters, one to Raymond&rsquo;s
grandmother telling her that she had guessed
wrong when she had &ldquo;guessed that Ray would
have to go to an orphan asylum when he came
back,&rdquo; and the other enclosing a check to Jeb
Rushmore and telling him that Raymond
would stay with him for the winter and to
please see to it that he had everything he
needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>That was in the previous autumn. Jeb had
gotten out his bespattered, pyramid-shaped
ink bottle and his atrocious pen and laboriously
scrawled his signature on the back of the
check and had it cashed in Leeds. He had
kept the little roll of bills carefully in his
pocket all winter, buying such things for Raymond
as were needed, and as the roll grew
thinner Raymond had grown stouter, until
now, in the spring, he weighed ninety-one
pounds and the roll was all gone except the
elastic band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>It seemed a pity that just at the opening of
the new season he should have to think of
going home and perhaps to an orphan asylum,
but if he had entertained any wild hope that
some fortunate circumstance might prolong
his stay into the open season it had been dissipated
when word had come that the Temples
had gone to South America. Either John
Temple had forgotten about the boy up in
the lonely camp or else he felt that he had
done as much for him as could be expected.
Raymond might still remain for two weeks of
the new season as any scout might do, but
then he would be at the end of his rope. For
the rule of Temple Camp was that any scout
or troop of scouts might spend two weeks at
the camp free of all cost. If a scout won an
honor medal it entitled his whole troop to additional
time, the time dependent on the nature
of the award. No scout might remain
at camp longer than two weeks except in accordance
with this provision, but permission
might be granted on the recommendation of
one of the trustees for a scout to <i>board</i> at camp
for a longer time if there were good reason.</p>
<p>One day, however, a registered letter had
come for Jeb. It contained fifty dollars and
a slip of paper bearing only the words: <i>For
Raymond Hollister to stay until September
first</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he remembered &rsquo;baout yer arter all,&rdquo;
Jeb had said, as pleased as Raymond himself.
&ldquo;I kinder knowed he would. If <i>he</i> ain&rsquo;t a
trusty (Jeb always said <i>trusty</i> when he meant
<i>trustee</i>) &rsquo;n&rsquo; got rights, gol, I dunno who has.
They wuz jest goin&rsquo; on th&rsquo;boat, I reckon, when
it popped inter his head like a dose uv buckshot
&rsquo;n&rsquo; he sent it right from th&rsquo;wharf.&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; N&rsquo;
I dun&rsquo;t hev ter get out my ink bottle &rsquo;n&rsquo; my old
double-barrelled pen ter <i>in</i>dorse, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>There they were&mdash;two twenties and a ten;
to Raymond they seemed like a fortune as he
watched Jeb fold them up and slip them into
his home-made buckskin wallet.</p>
<p>All this had happened before this auspicious
Saturday, but the dispelling of Raymond&rsquo;s
fears had given rise to new apprehensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;maybe Garry
won&rsquo;t be with them&mdash;maybe they won&rsquo;t stop
for him.&rdquo; Garry Everson was all that was
left of the little troop he had striven to keep
together the previous summer and the Bridgeboro
troop had promised to stop for him and
bring him along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then agin, mebbe they will,&rdquo; laughed
Jeb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think will be the first to get
here, Jeb?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe them lads from South New Jersey,
mebbe the Pennsylvany youngsters,&rdquo; said Jeb,
consulting his list from the home-made buckskin
wallet. The trustees kept these lists in
the neatest and most approved manner, but
Jeb had a system of record keeping all his
own. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, naouw, thar&rsquo;s thet troop
with the red-headed boy from Merryland&mdash;&rsquo;member
&rsquo;em, don&rsquo;t ye? They&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo;
all week, more&rsquo;n like. Seems ony like yist&rsquo;day,
thet that ole hill over thar wuz covered
with snow&mdash;&rsquo;member how me an&rsquo; you watched
it? We had a rough winter of it, didn&rsquo;t
we. Here, lemme feel yer muscle agin now.
Gee-williger! Gittin&rsquo; ter be a reg&rsquo;lar Samson,
ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that it&rsquo;s time for them to come,&rdquo; said
Raymond, slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sorry&mdash;kind of.
It was dandy being alone here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeb slapped him on the shoulder and
smiled again that smile that drew the wrinkles
like sun rays around his twinkling eyes, and
went about his work of preparation. Perhaps
he, too, rough old scout that he was, felt
that it had been &ldquo;dandy&rdquo; having little Raymond
alone with him through those long, cold
winter months.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>All day long Raymond kept his gaze
across Black Lake, for he knew that the
Bridgeboro boys, hiking it from the Hudson,
would come that way; but the hours of the
afternoon passed and there were no arrivals.
The hills surrounding the camp began to
darken in the twilight, save for the crimson
tinge upon their summits from the dying
sun; the dark waters of the lake grew more
sombre in the twilight and the still solemnity
of evening, which was nowhere more gloomy
and impressive than at this lakeside camp in
the hills, fell upon the scene and cast its spell
upon the lonely boy as it always did. But no
one came.</p>
<p>Jeb Rushmore strolled down to where Raymond
sat on the rough bench outside the provision
cabin, facing the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still watchin&rsquo;? If yew say so, I&rsquo;ll light
a lantern and we&rsquo;ll tow a couple uv skiffs
across and wait on &rsquo;tother side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about them just now,
Jeb; I was looking at those birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>High up, through the fading twilight, a
bird sped above the lake, toward the south.
Its course was straight as an arrow. Above
it a larger bird hovered and circled but the
smaller bird went straight upon its way, as if
bent upon some important mission.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the larger bird swooped
and there was only the one object left in the
dim vast sky where, a moment before, there
had been two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get me my rifle,&rdquo; said Jeb.</p>
<p>As Raymond hurried back with it, he could
see the wings of the big bird flapping in the
fury of its murderous work. What was going
on up there he could only picture in his mind&rsquo;s
eye, but the thought of that smaller bird hurrying
on its harmless errand&mdash;homeward to its
nest, perhaps&mdash;and waylaid and murdered up
there in the lonely half darkness, troubled him
and his hand trembled perceptibly as he handed
the weapon to Jeb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always hit &rsquo;em&mdash;fetch &rsquo;em&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purty near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp report rang out and echoed from
the surrounding hills. Even before it died
away there lay at Raymond&rsquo;s feet a hawk,
quite dead, while through the dim light in a
pitiably futile effort to fly, the smaller bird, a
vivid speck of white in the fading twilight,
fluttered to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>It proved to be a white pigeon, its feathers
ruffled and stained with blood and several
of the stiffer feathers of the tail were gone entirely.
One wing drooped as the bird
stumbled weakly about and an area of its neck
was bare where the feathers had been torn
away. It seemed odd to Raymond that the
poor stricken thing should resume its clumsy
strut, poking its head this way and that, even
in its weakness, and after such a cruel experience.</p>
<p>But what he noticed particularly was a
metal ring around the bird&rsquo;s leg from which
hung a little transparent tube, like a large
medical capsule, with something inside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jeb,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeb lifted the bird carefully, folding the
drooping wing into place, and removed the
little tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fetched him anyway, didn&rsquo;t you,
Jeb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I <i>had</i> ter&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to kill it, will we, Jeb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon not. He don&rsquo;t seem to be sufferin&rsquo;
much uv any. Jes&rsquo; shook up, as the feller
says. Lucky he fell amongst friends. Let&rsquo;s
see wot he&rsquo;s brought us&mdash;he&rsquo;s one of them
carriers, son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Raymond said nothing, but watched eagerly
as Jeb, leisurely and without any excitement,
opened the tiny receptacle and unrolled
a piece of paper. The boy knew well enough
what carrier pigeons were and he was eager
to know the purport of that little roll of script.
But even in his excitement there lingered in
his mind the picture of that faithful little
messenger, intent upon its errand, struck down
by the ruthless bandit of the air. He was
glad the hawk was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear wot he&rsquo;s got ter say fer himself,
son. You jes&rsquo; read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper was thin and about the size of
a dollar bill; it had been folded lengthwise
and then rolled up. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Come right away. Governor hurt.
Serious. Can&rsquo;t leave. Will try to get
to nearest village but am afraid to leave
now. He fell and is bleeding bad.
Think there&rsquo;s something else the matter,
too. Spotty died or would send.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Jeff.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raymond gazed for a moment at Jeb, then
down at the dead hawk, then at the pigeon
which Jeb still held, stroking it gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never be delivered now, son, &rsquo;cause
nobuddy &rsquo;cept this here little feller knows
whar he come frum nor whar he wuz goin&rsquo;&mdash;do
they, Pidge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But somebody&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, but we don&rsquo;t know who &rsquo;tis
nor <i>whar</i> he is&mdash;nor whar his friends is
neither. An&rsquo; this here messenger here won&rsquo;t
tell us&mdash;he&rsquo;s got his own troubles. That thar
hawk done more mischief than he thought
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments there was silence and
Raymond gazed up into the trackless, darkening
sky through which this urgent call for
help had been borne. Where had it come
from? For whom was it intended? Then
he looked down at the limp body of the bird
whose cruel, bloody work had snatched the
last faint hope of succor from someone who
lay dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad you kil&mdash;fetched him, anyway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>The thought of those two unknown persons,
the stricken one and his frightened companion,
waiting all in vain for the help which that
faithful messenger of the air should summon,
and of that steadfast little emissary, on whom
so much depended, fallen here into strange
hands, sobered and yet agitated the boy, and he
was silent in the utter helplessness of doing
anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Naow, if yer could ony tell whar yer wuz
goin&rsquo; or whar yer wuz comin&rsquo; frum, Pidge,
we&rsquo;d be much obleeged,&rdquo; said Jeb; &ldquo;but you
wouldn&rsquo;t, would yer,&rdquo; he added, stroking the
bird, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t much uv a hand at pickin&rsquo;
trails in th&rsquo;air, bein&rsquo; as I growed up on th&rsquo;hard
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can follow trails in the air,&rdquo; said
Raymond by way of comforting Jeb. &ldquo;Gee,
nobody could do that. But it&rsquo;s terrible, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up into the sky again as if he
hoped it might still show some sign of path or
trail, and as he did so a loud bark, a sort of
harsh <i>Haa-Haa</i>, came through the growing
darkness from across the lake, and reverberated
in swelling chorus from the frowning
heights roundabout. Then there was a long,
plaintive bellow which died away as softly
and as gradually as the day itself dies, and
this again was followed, as it seemed, by the
happy music of applauding hands, as if in acknowledgment
of the long echoed refrain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re here! They&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; cried
Raymond. &ldquo;That was the Silver Fox call&mdash;and
the Elks&mdash;and Garry&rsquo;s with them&mdash;he
made that Beaver call to let me know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Just at that moment the dense brush across
the lake parted and a boy, bareheaded and
wearing a grey flannel shirt, emerged on the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom! It&rsquo;s Tom Slade!&rdquo; cried Raymond,
forgetting all else in his ecstasy. &ldquo;Hello,
Tom, you big&mdash;you big&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But he
couldn&rsquo;t think of any epithet to fit the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">TOM SURPRISES THE CAMP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Believe <i>me</i>, it was good to get our feet
on terra-cotta&mdash;I mean terra firma. I don&rsquo;t
want any more life on the ocean wave for at
least two weeks. I&rsquo;m sorry we didn&rsquo;t christen
that boat the <i>Sardine Box</i>. <i>Good Turn</i>&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t even turn around in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the
mouth,&rdquo; someone laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can look a gift boat in the cabin, can&rsquo;t
you,&rdquo; continued Roy. &ldquo;We were crowded in
the cabin, not a soul would dare to move.
That boat is all right for three scouts like last
year, but for three patrols&mdash;go-o-d night!
There wasn&rsquo;t even room to flop a rice cake
over&mdash;we had to eat them browned on one
side&mdash;there was a wrong and a right to them.
Never again! What we want is a sump-tu-ous
yacht like that one moored at Catskill
Landing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, ye did hev quite a crowd aboard,
sure enough,&rdquo; laughed Jeb, who always enjoyed
Roy&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, pick out the one you want and I&rsquo;ll
drown the rest,&rdquo; said Roy; &ldquo;except Pee-wee,
we&rsquo;re going to keep him till he gets his eyes
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pee-wee Harris, Silver Fox and troop mascot,
splashed the oar from his seat in an adjoining
boat, giving Roy a gratuitous bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have any adventures?&rdquo; Raymond
managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oceans of them&mdash;I mean rivers. We got
three points out of our course and went twenty
miles up a tributary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some word,&rdquo; someone called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a peach of a word, comes from the
Greek word <i>Bute</i>, meaning beautiful, and the
Irish word <i>Terry</i>. It was all on account of
Pee-wee&rsquo;s ignorance of geography. He
thought the Hudson rose in Roseville, Pennsylvania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to our beloved scoutmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our beloved scoutmaster,&rdquo; who was rowing
one of the skiffs, only smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know more about geography than you
do,&rdquo; shouted the irrepressible Pee-wee; &ldquo;<i>he</i>
thought Newburgh was below Peekskill,&rdquo; he
added, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> thought Sandy Hook was a Scotchman,&rdquo;
retorted Roy. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the news,
Jeb, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer didn&rsquo;t give us no chance ter tell yer,&rdquo;
drawled Jeb, as they drew the boats up on
shore. &ldquo;Mebbe yer think yer wuz the fust
arrivals, but yer wuzn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was good to hear Roy&rsquo;s familiar nonsense;
Raymond, who was quiet and easily
amused, saw with joy that the ancient hostilities
between Roy and Pee-wee were still in
full swing; and for all Roy&rsquo;s dubious picture
of an overcrowded boat (and so it must have
been) they had found it possible to stop down
the river for Garry Everson and bring him
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last of the Mohicans,&rdquo; said Roy, as he
dragged Garry forward; &ldquo;all that&rsquo;s left of the
famous Edgevale troop&mdash;left over from last
summer. The only original has-been. Them
wuz the happy days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>There was Tom Slade, too, quiet and stolid
as he always was and with no more sign of
the scout regalia than he had shown when he
was a hoodlum down in Barrel Alley. His
gray flannel shirt and last year&rsquo;s khaki trousers
were in odd contrast to the new outfits which
the other members of the Bridgeboro Troop
wore. But then Tom was in odd contrast
with everything and everybody anyway.</p>
<p>Two troops which had come up by the train
had joined them at Catskill Landing so the
new arrivals descended like an all-conquering
host upon the quiet monotony of the big camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to stay till September,&rdquo;
said Raymond, clinging to Garry and talking
to both Garry and Roy. &ldquo;Mr. Temple sent
the money. Do you remember how I couldn&rsquo;t
raise the flag last summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were about as tough as a Welsbach
gas mantel last summer,&rdquo; laughed Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now I can raise it with one hand
and I can hike to Leeds and back. But listen&mdash;<i>listen</i>;
we&rsquo;ve got a mystery&mdash;it just happened&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Tom,&rdquo; laughed Roy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the fellow for mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>But in another minute he had abandoned
his gay tone as the little company stood gazing
down upon the dead hawk, while Jeb held a
lantern, and listened to Raymond&rsquo;s breathless
account of what had happened.</p>
<p>It had a sobering effect upon them all, and
as Mr. Ellsworth, the Bridgeboro Troop&rsquo;s
scoutmaster, held that pathetic note and read
it in the lantern light, with the scouts clustering
about him, he shook his head ruefully.</p>
<p>The note was passed about among the boys,
who fingered it curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stalking blank, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said Tom,
as he handed it to Westy Martin, of the Silver
Foxes, who wore the stalking badge. &ldquo;The
printed part has been torn off so&rsquo;s to get it
into that little holder. See?&rdquo; he added, rubbing
his finger along the edge, &ldquo;it came off a
pad&mdash;a stalking pad&mdash;one of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
named the sporting goods concern which made
them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same kind you and I used
at Salmon River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement, made in Tom&rsquo;s usual
stolid, half-interested way, fell like a bombshell
among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can we find them? Can we find
them?&rdquo; cried Raymond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that doesn&rsquo;t do us much good,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;We already knew
that the message was sent from some isolated
place or help would have been procurable.
That being the case, I don&rsquo;t see how the sender
happened to have a pigeon handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had more than one, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
said Tom, quietly, &ldquo;but the other died&mdash;Spotty.
It must have been sent by some one
who&rsquo;s stalking and a fellow who&rsquo;s that much
interested in birds would be just the kind of a
fellow that might have carrier pigeons&mdash;it&rsquo;s
good sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but where is he&mdash;or they? There&rsquo;s
two of them, anyway,&rdquo; said Doc Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for us to find out,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to sit down here and eat my
supper with someone dying.&rdquo; He kicked the
body of the hawk slightly as if to express his
disgust that this insignificant creature could
cause such trouble and baffle even scouts. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know much about it but we&rsquo;ll have to
use what little we do know. I know that
when people try out carrier pigeons they
always get a high ground, and I know that up
on that hill over there&mdash;in the woods&mdash;there
were chalk marks on the trees last summer.
Maybe someone was stalking there then. Anyway,
I&rsquo;m going to get to the top of that hill
and see if I can find anyone up there. I want
Doc to go with me. Anybody else can go
that wants to. If there&rsquo;s anybody there we&rsquo;ll
wigwag or <a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>smudge
it to you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>For a moment there was silence. It was
exactly like Tom to blurt out his plans with
a kind of stolid bluntness, and if he had contemplated
a trip to the moon he would have
announced it in the same dull way. He seldom
asked advice and as seldom asked authority.
He was a kind of law unto himself. If
anyone knew how to take Tom it was Roy
Blakeley, but Roy often threw up his hands
in despair and said he gave it up&mdash;Tom was a
puzzle. He stood there among them now,
his face about as expressionless as an Indian&rsquo;s&mdash;coarse
gray flannel shirt open halfway down
to his waist, a strap by way of a belt, and his
shock of thick hair down on his forehead.
Why he had eschewed the scout regalia while
the others came resplendent in their new outfits
was a mystery. What advantage over a
belt the thin strap had, no one knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go with you! I&rsquo;ll go with you!&rdquo;
shouted the irrepressible Pee-wee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just sit down and have some supper,&rdquo;
laughed Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>It is to be feared that the scoutmaster had
small hope of anything coming from Tom&rsquo;s
proposed expedition, but he was not the one to
discourage his scouts nor obtrude his authority.
So the little party was made up (for
whatever slight prospect of success it might
afford) of Tom, Doc Carson, Raven and
First Aid Scout, Connie Bennet of Tom&rsquo;s
patrol, and Garry Everson who, though not
a member of the troop, was asked because of
his proficiency in signalling. Roy, who
would naturally have gone, was asked by Mr.
Ellsworth to remain at camp to help him get
the troop&rsquo;s baggage distributed in the several
cabins that had been reserved for them.</p>
<p>So the four scouts, having taken a hasty bite
of supper, set out in the darkness on their all
but hopeless errand. Tom carried a lantern;
across Doc Carson&rsquo;s back was slung the folding
stretcher; Connie Bennet carried the bandages
and first-aid case, and all wore belt axes,
for the hill which they meant to climb was
covered with a dense thicket and even in the
lower land between it and the camp there was
no sign of path or trail after the first mile or
so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">ROY&rsquo;S CAMPFIRE YARN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for being small,&rdquo;
sighed Pee-wee to Raymond Hollister, as they
strolled about together while waiting for supper.
&ldquo;When you say you want to go with
them or tell them about an idea you have, they
just laugh at you, or don&rsquo;t pay any attention.
It just goes in one ear and out the other&mdash;because
there&rsquo;s nothing to stop it, as Roy says.
Gee, you have to laugh at that feller. He
makes me awful mad sometimes&mdash;when he
gets to jollying&mdash;but you have to laugh at
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what he told me last summer?&rdquo;
said Raymond; &ldquo;he was telling me
about the echoes and he said if I called Merry
Christmas good and hard it would answer
Happy New Year!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like him,&rdquo; said Pee-wee, &ldquo;you
have to look out for him. When I first joined
his patrol he told me a lot of stuff. He said
if a feller had a malicious look it was a sign
he belonged to the militia. He&rsquo;ll be jollying
you and me all the time we&rsquo;re here&mdash;you see
if he isn&rsquo;t. He calls me a scoutlet. And
it&rsquo;ll be the same with you, only worse, because
you&rsquo;re even smaller than I am. What
do you say we stick together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Raymond, &ldquo;but I like
Roy,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I like him better than any
of your patrol&mdash;I like him better than Tom
Slade&mdash;a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; said Pee-wee, &ldquo;but
he&rsquo;s kind of queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look like a scout at all&mdash;not
this year,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking mostly about his patrol,&rdquo;
said Pee-wee, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s nutty about his patrol. He
needs one more member. Roy and two or
three others&mdash;Westy, he&rsquo;s pretty near as bad&mdash;they
made a big rag doll with a punkin for a
head and brought it to scout meeting as a new
member for Tom&rsquo;s patrol. Coming up the
river there was a scarecrow in a field and Roy
said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your new member for you,
Tom.&rsquo; Oh, gee, but we did have some fun
cruising up. Sometimes I got mad when
they kidded me, but most of the time I had to
laugh&mdash;especially when Roy gave an imitation
of a dying radiator&mdash;gee, that feller&rsquo;s
the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Raymond enjoyed these tidbits of gossip
about the Bridgeboro Troop, the members of
which were all more or less heroes to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Garry best of all,&rdquo; he suddenly
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody likes him,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just as smart as any scout in your
troop,&rdquo; Raymond added, with the faintest
note of challenge in his tone.</p>
<p>The welcome sound of the supper horn
brought their talk to an end. It was a merry
company that gathered about one of the three
long boards (the other two were as yet unused)
and to the scouts who were visiting Temple
Camp for the first time this late evening meal,
served by lantern light under the sombre trees
with the still, black lake hard by and the
frowning hills encompassing them, was most
delightful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>There were few among them (least of all
Jeb and the scoutmaster) who believed that
anything would be accomplished by Tom&rsquo;s expedition
but even a hopeless enterprise seemed
more scoutish than doing nothing and Mr.
Ellsworth was certainly not the one to deny his
scouts any adventure even though it offered
nothing more than a forlorn hope.</p>
<p>After supper some one suggested campfire
and soon the cheerful, crackling blaze which
seems to typify the very spirit of scouting was
luring the boys back from pavilion and cabin
and they lolled on the ground about it as it
grew in volume and glittered in the black
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say we tell riddles?&rdquo; suggested
Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Roy, who was poking the
fire. &ldquo;Riddle number one, How much is
twice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you stir your coffee with your left
hand?&rdquo; shouted Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, with a spoon,&rdquo; said Roy; &ldquo;no sooner
said than stung!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell a story, Roy,&rdquo; some one called, and
half dozen others, who had already fallen under
Roy&rsquo;s spell, chimed in, &ldquo;Sure, go ahead&mdash;story,
story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Roy, drawing his knees up and
clasping his hands about them. &ldquo;Once there
was a scout&mdash;anybody got a harmonica for
some soft music? No? Well, once there
was a scout and he was tracking. He came
to a stone wall and in climbing over it he
fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts don&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; shouted the irrepressible
Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s telling this?&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;As he
was climbing over the stone wall he fell. He
fell on his face&mdash;and hurt his feelings. He
was self-conscious&mdash;I mean sub-conscious&mdash;I
mean unconscious. He shouted for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was unconscious?&rdquo; ventured
Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But no help came. The sun
was slowly sinking. The scout was a fiend
on first-aid. He opened his case and got out
a bottle of camphor. He smelled it. He
opened his eyes slowly and came to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me sick!&rdquo; shouted Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a big scratch on his knee,&rdquo; Roy
continued. &ldquo;There was a hole in his stocking&mdash;about
as big as a seventy-five cent piece.
He looked about but could not find the piece
of stocking the size of a seventy-five cent piece
that had come out of the hole. Where was
it? The hole was there&mdash;the whole hole; but
where was the part of the stocking that had
been in the hole? He looked about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Topple him over backwards, will you!&rdquo;
called Pee-wee, in a disgusted appeal to Roy&rsquo;s
nearest neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked about some more. Then he sat
up. Then he sat down. He was a scout&mdash;he
was resourceful. He happened to remember
that once he had eaten a doughnut. The
doughnut had a hole in it. The hole disappeared.
He said to himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was not allowed to go further, for
somebody inverted him according to Pee-wee&rsquo;s
suggestion, and when the general laugh had
subsided a boy who had said very little spoke
up, half laughing but evidently in earnest and
greatly interested in Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were rowing across the lake,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you made some remark about your
motor-boat being overcrowded on the trip
up and I got an idea from some things that
were said that two or three of you came up
here alone last year. It struck me that you
might have had some interesting experiences
from the way you spoke. I wanted to go with
your friends off to that hill, but I didn&rsquo;t just
like to ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with him,&rdquo; a smaller
boy beside him, who was evidently his friend,
piped up. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like to butt in&mdash;gee,
you&rsquo;d never think he was a hero from the way
he acts&mdash;or the way he talks either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older boy took the general laugh good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;if you wouldn&rsquo;t tell us something about your
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> had a lot of adventures, too,&rdquo; piped
up the smaller boy, &ldquo;and saved people&rsquo;s lives&mdash;and
things&mdash;and won plaudits&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won <i>what</i>?&rdquo; someone queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plaudits,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;they are things
like&mdash;like&mdash;well, applause, kind of. But he
don&rsquo;t know very much about girls, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is <i>your</i> name?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ellsworth,
amid the general laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gordon Lord&mdash;and his is Harry Arnold&mdash;he
can swim two miles and back and he can&mdash;he
can&mdash;he can make raisin pudding,&rdquo; he
concluded, lamely. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got a tattoo
mark on his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delaware?&rdquo; Roy queried, smiling across
the blaze at Arnold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, New Jersey&mdash;Oakwood, New Jersey&mdash;First
Oakwood Troop&mdash;Hawk Patrol, we
are. I guess we&rsquo;re a little bit ashamed of our
patrol name just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>There was silence for a minute as all
thought of the tragic message which had fallen
into the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should worry about the name,&rdquo; said
Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s anything we can
do,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, voicing the thought
which held all silent, &ldquo;but sit here and wait,
and if we&rsquo;re sensible we won&rsquo;t hope for too
much. Come, Roy, let our new friends hear
about you boys coming up in the <i>Good Turn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that big cruiser down at Catskill
Landing, is it?&rdquo; Arnold inquired. &ldquo;We saw
that as we got off the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s the kind of a yacht boys have in
twenty-five cent stories,&rdquo; said Roy; &ldquo;I saw that
one; it&rsquo;s a pippin, isn&rsquo;t it? Guess it belongs
to a millionaire, hey? No, ours is just a little
cabin launch&mdash;poor, but honest, tangoes along
at about six miles an hour and isn&rsquo;t ashamed.
Do you want the full story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there aren&rsquo;t any stockings and stone-walls
in it,&rdquo; someone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here goes,&rdquo; said Roy, settling,
himself into his favorite posture before the
fire, with his hands clasped about his drawn-up
knees and the bright blaze lighting up his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it was this way. Pee-wee Harris
is the what&rsquo;d you say his name is&mdash;Lord? Pee-wee
Harris over there is the Gordon Lord of
our troop. And Tom Slade is our famous detective&mdash;Sherlock
Nobody Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom and Pee-wee and I started
ahead of the others last summer to hike it up
here. Pee-wee got very tired (here he dodged
a missile from Pee-wee) and so we were all
glad when we got a little above Nyack and
things began to happen. They happened in
large chunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the way up Pee-wee captured a pet
bird that belonged to a little girl (oh, he&rsquo;s a
regular gallant little lad, he is); he got the
bird down out of a tree for her and to show
how happy she was she began to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, they&rsquo;re awful funny, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
commented Gordon Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we beat it along till we hit the Hudson,
then we started north. The shadows of
night were falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read that in a book,&rdquo; interrupted Pee-wee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Little Raymond was greatly amused. So
was Mr. Ellsworth who poked up the fire and
resumed his seat on the old bench beside Jeb
Rushmore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Team work,&rdquo; someone suggested, slyly, indicating
Gordon and Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kindergarten class will please be
quiet,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;I repeat, the shadows of
night were tumbling. It began to rain. And
it rained, and it rained&mdash;and it rained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, we saw this boat&mdash;we thought it
was a shanty at first&mdash;in the middle of a big
marsh. So we plowed our way through the
muck and crawled into it. Pity the poor sailors
on a night like that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, believe me, it was too sweet for
anything in that old cabin. Pee-wee wasn&rsquo;t
homesick any more (here Roy dodged again)
and we settled down for the night. The rain
came down in sheets and pillowcases and
things and the cruel wind played havoc&mdash;I
mean it blew&mdash;and shook the old boat just as
if she&rsquo;d been in the water. But what cared
we&mdash;yo, ho, my lads&mdash;we cared naught!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the morning along came an old
codger with a badge and said he was a sheriff.
He was looking for an escaped convict and
we didn&rsquo;t suit. He told us the boat was owned
by an old grouch in Nyack and said if we
didn&rsquo;t want to be arrested for trespassing and
destroying property we&rsquo;d better beat it. He
told us some more about the old grouch, and
I guess Pee-wee and I thought the best thing
to do was to hike it right along for Haverstraw
and not wait for trouble. We had chopped up
a couple of old stanchions for firewood&mdash;worth
about two Canadian dimes, they were, but our
friend said old What&rsquo;s-his-name would be only
too glad to call that stealing and send us to
jail. Honest, that old hulk was a <i>sight</i>. You
wouldn&rsquo;t have thought anybody would want
to admit that he owned such a ramshackle old
pile of junk and that&rsquo;s why we made so free
with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, zip goes the fillum! Here&rsquo;s where
Tom comes on the scene. He said that if that
was the kind of a gink Old Crusty was we&rsquo;d
have to go and see him and tell him what we&rsquo;d
done. He just blurted it out in that sober way
of his and Pee-wee was scared out of his&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Pee-wee landed a wad of uprooted
grass in Roy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pee-wee, as I said, was&mdash;with us (dodging
again). The sheriff must have thought Tom
was crazy. He gave us a&mdash;some kind of a
scope&mdash;what d&rsquo;you call it&mdash;when they read
your fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horoscope?&rdquo; suggested Arnold, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct&mdash;I thank you. He told us that
we&rsquo;d be in jail by night. You ought to have
seen Pee-wee stare. I told him <i>he</i> ought not
to kick&mdash;he&rsquo;d been shouting for adventures and
here was a good one. So we trotted back to
Nyack behind Tom and strode boldly up to
Old Crusty&rsquo;s office and&mdash;here&rsquo;s where the film
changes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me
started now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who do you think Old Crusty was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the escaped convict!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life! He turned out to be
the father of the little girl whose pet bird
Pee-wee had captured the day before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot grows thinner,&rdquo; said someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he had all the signs of an old grouch,
hair ruffled up, spectacles half-way down his
nose&mdash;but he fell for Pee-wee, you can bet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When he found out who we were (the girl
must have told him about us, I suppose) he
got kind of interested and when Pee-wee
started to explain things he couldn&rsquo;t keep from
laughing. Well, in the end he said the only
way we could square ourselves was to take the
boat away; he said it belonged to his son who
was dead, and that he didn&rsquo;t want it and we
were welcome to it and he&rsquo;d send us a couple
of men to help us launch it. He seemed to
feel pretty bad when he mentioned his son and
we were so surprised and excited at getting
the boat that we just stood there gaping. Gee,
how can you thank a man when he gives you
a cabin launch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we spent a couple of days and eight
dollars and fifty-two cents fixing the boat up
and then, sure enough, along came two men
and Mr. Stanton&rsquo;s chauffeur to jack the boat
over and launch her for us. The girl came
along, too, in their auto, and oh, wasn&rsquo;t she
tickled! Brought us a lot of eats and a flag
she&rsquo;d made, and stayed to wish us&mdash;what do
you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bon voyage?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Correct&mdash;I thank you. Understand, I&rsquo;m
only giving you the facts. We had more fun
those three days and that night launching the
boat than you could shake a stick at. Well,
when we got her in the water I noticed the girl
had gone off a little way and kept staring at it.
Gee, the boat did look pretty nice when she
got in the water. I thought maybe she was
kind of thinking about her brother, you know,
and it put it into my head to ask one of the men
how he died. She didn&rsquo;t come near us while
we talked, but stood off there by herself staring
at the launch. You see, it was the first
time she&rsquo;d seen it in the water since he was
lost, and she was almost crying&mdash;I could tell
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is what the man told me. They
said this Harry Stanton and another fellow
named Benty Willis were out in the launch
on a stormy night. There was a skiff belonging
to the launch, and people thought they
must have been in that, fishing. Anyway, the
next morning, they found the skiff broken
and swamped to her gunwale and right near
it the body of the other fellow. The launch
was riding on her anchor same as the night
before. The men said Mr. Stanton was so
broken up that he had the boat hauled ashore
and a flood carried her up on the marsh where
she was going to pieces when we found her.
He would never look at her again. They said
Harry Stanton could swim and that made some
people think that maybe they were run down
by one of the big night boats on the Hudson
and that Harry was injured&mdash;killed that way,
maybe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, when the girl got in the auto and
said good-bye to us I could see she&rsquo;d been
crying all right, and she said we must be careful
and not run at night on account of the big
liners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; said Arnold, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;ll never forget that night, with her
sitting in the auto ready to start home and the
boat rocking in the water and waiting for us.
I can&rsquo;t stand seeing a girl cry, can you? I
guess we all felt kind of sober when we said
good-bye and she told us to be careful. Tom
told her we&rsquo;d try to do a <i>real</i> good turn some
day to pay her back, because we really owed
it to her, you know, and there was something
in the way he said it&mdash;you know how Tom
blurts things out&mdash;that made me think he had
an idea up his sleeve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was about an hour later, while
we were sitting on the cabin roof, that Tom
sprung it on us. We were going to start up
river in the morning; we were just loafing&mdash;gee,
it was nice in the moonlight!&mdash;when he
said it would be a great thing for us to find
Harry Stanton! Go-o-d ni-i-ght! I was kind
of sore at him because I didn&rsquo;t like to hear
him joking, sort of, about a fellow that was
dead, especially after what the fellow&rsquo;s father
and sister had done for us, but he came right
back at me by pointing to the board we had
the oil stove on. What do you think he did?
He showed us the letters N Y M P H under
the fresh paint and said that board was part of
the launch&rsquo;s old skiff and wanted to know how
it got back to the launch. What do you know
about that? You see, we had run short of
paint and it was thin on that board because
we&rsquo;d mixed gasoline with it. We ought to
have mixed it with cod liver oil, hey?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there you are,&rdquo; concluded Roy; &ldquo;Pee-wee
and I just stared like a couple of gumps.
Those fellows had been out in the skiff and
they couldn&rsquo;t have used it with that side plank
ripped off. And how did it get back to the
launch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if the man might have been
right about the skiff being smashed by a big
boat,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;Maybe Harry Stanton
was injured and clung to that board. But why
should he have pulled it aboard the launch?
And what I can&rsquo;t understand is that nobody
should have noticed it except you fellows. Was
it in the launch all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yup&mdash;right under one of the lockers. Pee-wee
and I had hauled it out to make a shelf
for the oil stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you suppose it was no one had
noticed it till you fellows got busy with the
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scout is observant,&rdquo; said Roy, laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph&mdash;it&rsquo;s mighty interesting, anyway,&rdquo;
mused Arnold. He drummed on a log with
his fingers, and for a few moments no one
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some mystery, hey?&rdquo; said Roy, adding a
log to the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE OLD TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Several things more or less firmly fixed
in his mind had impelled Tom Slade to challenge
that wooded hill the dense summit of
which was visible by day from Temple Camp.</p>
<p>He knew that high land is always selected
for despatching carrier pigeons; a certain
book on stalking which he had read contained
a chapter on this fascinating and often useful
sport and he knew that in a general sort of
way there was a connection between carrier
pigeons and stalking; one suggested the other&mdash;to
him, at least. He knew for a certainty
that the message had been written on the unprinted
part of a stalking blank and he knew
also that on the slope of the hill he had seen
chalk marks on the trees the previous summer.
Tom seldom forgot anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>All these facts, whether significant or not,
were indelibly impressed upon his serious
mind, and to him they seemed to bear relation
to each other. He believed that the pigeon had
been flying homeward, to some town or city not
far distant, where the sender perhaps lived
and he believed that the pigeon&rsquo;s use in this
emergency had been the happy thought of
some person who had taken the bird to the hill
only to use for sport. He had no doubt that
somewhere in the wilderness of these Catskill
hills was a camp where the victim of accident
lay, but the weak point was that he was seeking
a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d brought along the fog horn
from the boat,&rdquo; he said, as they made their
way across the open country below the hill;
&ldquo;we could have made a lot of noise with it
up there; you can hear a long way in the
woods, and it might have helped us to find the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the place is up there,&rdquo; said Doc Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trail,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that runs
about halfway up but it peters out at a brook
and you can&rsquo;t find any from there on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could find the trees where you saw
the marks last summer,&rdquo; said Connie Bennet,
&ldquo;we might get next to some clue there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can usually find a place where I&rsquo;ve been
before,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with following the
brook when we get to it?&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;If
there&rsquo;s anyone camping there they&rsquo;d have to
be near water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles one thing I was trying to dope
out,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Why should people come as
far as that just to stalk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re scouts, camping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have smudged up the whole sky
with signals,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s someone up there hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only it isn&rsquo;t the season,&rdquo; laughed Garry.
&ldquo;No sooner said than stung, as Roy would say.
Gee, I wish he was along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably there fishing,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;The stalking business is a side issue, most
likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the little brook whispers to
us,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>They all laughed except Tom. He was not
much on laughing, though Roy could usually
reach him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The woods began abruptly at the foot of
the hill and they skirted its edge for a little
way holding their lantern to the ground so as
to find the trail. But no sign of path revealed
itself. Twice they fancied they could see, or
<i>sense</i>, as Jeb would have said, an opening into
the dense woods and the faintest suggestion
of a trail but it petered out in both cases&mdash;or
perhaps it was imaginary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try what Jeb calls lassooing it,&rdquo; said
Garry.</p>
<p>He retreated through the open field to a
lone tree which stood gaunt and spectral in
the night like a sentinel on guard before that
vast woodland army. Climbing up the tree,
he called to Tom:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk along the edge now and hold your
lantern low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom skirted the wood&rsquo;s edge, swinging his
light this way and that as Garry called to him.
The idea of trying to discover the trail by taking
a distant and elevated view was a good
one, but the tree was either too near or too far
or the light was too dim, and the four scouts
knew not what to do next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Climb up a little higher,&rdquo; called Doc.
&ldquo;They say that when you&rsquo;re up in an aeroplane
you can see all sorts of paths that people
below never knew about. I read that in an
aviation magazine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Fly-paper</i>, hey?&rdquo; ventured Connie.
&ldquo;Look out for rotten branches, Garry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry wriggled his way up among the small
branches, as far as he dared, while Tom moved
about at the wood&rsquo;s edge holding the lantern
here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; said Garry, coming down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re up against it, for a fact,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; retorted Connie.
&ldquo;It seems we&rsquo;re nowhere near it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whillager!&rdquo; cried Garry as he
scrambled down the tree trunk. &ldquo;Sling me
over the peroxide, will you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Doc, interested
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a scratch. What Pee-wee would
call an artificial abrasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superficial?&rdquo; laughed Doc, pouring peroxide
on a pretty deep scratch on Garry&rsquo;s
wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there?&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Feel. It&rsquo;s
sticking out from the trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Tom held his lantern a small, rusty
projection of iron was visible on the trunk of
the tree about five feet from the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a nail?&rdquo; asked Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well-what-do-you-know-about-that?&rdquo; said
Garry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left of a hook; the tree
has grown out all around it, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed the rusty remnant of what
had once been a hook but the growing trunk
had encased all except the end of it and the
screws and plate that fastened it were hidden
somewhere within the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tree has grown about an inch and
a half thicker all the way around since the
hook was fastened to it,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an elm, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<p>Tom thought a minute. &ldquo;Elms, oaks,&rdquo; he
mused, &ldquo;that means about ten or twelve years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two reasons why people
put hooks into trees,&rdquo; said Connie, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence; &ldquo;for hammocks and to fasten
horses to. Nix on the hammocks here,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I was thinking about,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;is that if somebody used to tie a horse here
it must have been so&rsquo;s they could go into the
woods. The trail goes as far up as the brook.
Maybe they used to tie their horses here and
go fishing. There ought to be a trail from this
tree to where the trail begins in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably there was&mdash;twelve years ago,&rdquo;
said Doc, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground where a trail was is never
just the same as where one wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom,
with a clumsy phraseology that was characteristic
of him. &ldquo;It leaves a scar&mdash;like.
When they started the Panama Canal they
found a trail that was used in the Fifteenth
Century&mdash;an aviator found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Garry, cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
aviate to the top of this tree again and take
a squint straight down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your eyes and keep them shut,&rdquo; Tom
called up to him; &ldquo;keep them shut till I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till Tom says peek-a-boo!&rdquo; called
Connie.</p>
<p>Tom gathered some twigs that were none
too dry, and pouring a little kerosene over
them, kindled a small fire about six feet from
the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see down here all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with my eyes shut,&rdquo; Garry answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, open them,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and see if
the leaves keep you from seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What he means,&rdquo; called Doc, &ldquo;is, have
you an unobstructed view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was always this tendency to make
fun of Tom&rsquo;s soberness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I look in my pocket,&rdquo; called
Garry. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ve got one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your eyes again and keep them shut,&rdquo;
commanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have did it,&rdquo; came from above.</p>
<p>With a couple of sticks which he manipulated
like Chinese chopsticks, Tom moved the
fire a little to a spot which seemed to suit him
better, then retreated with his lantern to the
wood&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he called; &ldquo;quick, what do you see?
Quick!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it at all
unless you do it quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your left!&rdquo; shouted Garry. &ldquo;Down
that way&mdash;farther&mdash;farther still&mdash;go on&mdash;more.
Hurry up! Just a&mdash;there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys ran to the spot where Tom stood
and a few swings of the lantern showed an
unmistakable something&mdash;certainly not a path&mdash;hardly
a trail&mdash;but a way of lesser resistance,
as one might say, into the dense wood
interior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I hope the kerosene
holds out&mdash;I dumped out a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively, they fell back for him to lead
the way and scarcely a tree but he paused to
consider whether he should pass to the left
or the right of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; Connie asked of
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said Garry, still
amazed at his own experience, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
as I saw anything; I suppose I sensed it, as
Jeb would say. It was kind of like a little dirty
green line from the tree and it kept fading
away the longer I had my eyes open. It wasn&rsquo;t
exactly a line, either,&rdquo; he corrected; &ldquo;it was&mdash;oh,
I don&rsquo;t know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a ghost,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good name for it,&rdquo; conceded
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right name for it,&rdquo; said Tom, with
that blunt outspokenness which had a savor
of reprimand but which the boys usually took
in good part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about what I&rsquo;d say it was,&rdquo;
Garry agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you ought to say it was,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc winked at Garry, and Connie smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We get you, Steven,&rdquo; he said to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even before there were any flying machines,
scouts in Africa knew about trail ghosts,&rdquo;
Tom said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all over, only you can&rsquo;t
see them&mdash;except in special ways&mdash;like this.
You can only see them for about twenty seconds
when you open your eyes. If I&rsquo;d have
told you to look cross-eyed you could have
seen it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that have been a sight for mother&rsquo;s
boy!&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Swinging on a thin
branch on the top of a tree and looking cross-eyed
at a ghost! I&rsquo;d have had that Cheshire
cat in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> beaten a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Crawford who died,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;picked up a lot of them. The higher up you
are the better. In an aeroplane you needn&rsquo;t
even shut your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, truth is stranger than friction, as
Roy says,&rdquo; said Connie; &ldquo;this trail we&rsquo;re on
now is no ghost, anyway&mdash;hey, Tomasso?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a splinter in my finger, too,&rdquo; said
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been scratching your head,&rdquo;
said Connie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get from seein&rsquo; things,&rdquo;
said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll string the life out of Pee-wee, hey?&rdquo;
said Doc. &ldquo;Tell him we saw a ghost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; Tom insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Garry did,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;Of
course, we have to take his word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffalo Bill saw them, too,&rdquo; said Tom,
plodding on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Bill Cody!&rdquo; ejaculated Doc, winking
at Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>possible</i>?&rdquo; said Doc, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you
read that&mdash;in the <i>Fly-paper</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trail ghost a hundred miles long
out in Utah that nobody on the ground ever
saw. Curtis followed it in his biplane,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy that!&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>Tom plodded on ahead of them, in his usual
stolid manner. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you can always
do it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s kind of&mdash;something&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a long word&mdash;sike&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psychological?&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;We get you,
Tomasso.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">ADVENTURE OF THE RESCUE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I bet there are real ghosts in here,&rdquo; said
Garry, as they climbed the slope which became
more difficult as they went along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular ones, hey?&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, the good old-fashioned kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No peek-a-boo ghosts,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can knock ghosts all you want
to,&rdquo; said Connie, &ldquo;but I always found them
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slap him on the wrist, will you!&rdquo; called
Doc. &ldquo;Believe <i>me</i>, this is some impenetrable
wilderness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impenetrable wilderness&mdash;reduced to a
common denominator, thick woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Withal their bantering talk, it seemed indeed
as if the woods might be haunted, for
with almost every step they took some crackling
or rustling sound could be heard, emphasized
by the stillness. Now and again they
paused to listen to a light patter growing fainter
and fainter, or a sudden noise as of some
startled denizen of the wood seeking a new
shelter. Ghostly shadows flitted here and
there in the moonlight; and the night breeze,
soughing among the tree tops, wafted to the
boys a murmuring as of some living thing
whose elusive tones now and again counterfeited
the human voice in seeming pain or
fear.</p>
<p>The voices of the boys sounded crystal clear
in the solemn stillness. Once they paused,
trying to locate an owl which seemed to be
shrieking its complaint at this intrusion of its
domain. Again they stopped to listen to the
distant sound of falling water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the brook, I guess,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Their approach to it seemed to sober the
others, realizing as they did that effort and
resourcefulness were now imperative, and
mindful, too, though scarcely hopeful, that
these might bring them face to face with a
tragic scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tough, being up here all alone
with somebody dying,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something,&rdquo; answered Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>They were entering an area of underbrush,
where the trail ceased or was completely obscured,
so that there wasn&rsquo;t even a ghost of it,
as Doc remarked. But the sound of the water
guided them now and they worked their way
through such a dense maze of jungle as they
had never expected to encounter outside the
tropics.</p>
<p>Tom, going ahead, tore the tangled growth
away, or parted it enough to squeeze through,
the others following and carrying the stretcher
and first-aid case with greatest difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is this surging thoroughfare, I
wonder,&rdquo; asked Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to
have my bearings at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little while they emerged, scratched
and dishevelled, at the brook which tumbled
over its pebbly bed in its devious path downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty high up, do you know that?&rdquo;
Doc observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as there&rsquo;s much use hunting
for marked trees,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;I must have
come another way before. I don&rsquo;t know
where we&rsquo;re at. What d&rsquo;you say we all shout
together?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>This they did and the sound of their upraised
voices reverberated in the dense woods
and shocked the still night, but no answering
sound could be heard save only the rippling of
the brook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stand about as much chance as a snowball
in a blast furnace,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing to do,&rdquo; said Tom, ignoring him,
&ldquo;is to follow this brook, somebody on each
side, and look for a trail. If there&rsquo;s anybody
here they&rsquo;ll be upstream; it&rsquo;s too steep from
here down. And one thing sure&mdash;they&rsquo;d have
to have water. Lucky the moon&rsquo;s out, but I
wish we had two lanterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky if the oil in this one lasts,&rdquo;
Doc put in.</p>
<p>Following the stream was difficult enough,
but it was easier than the forest they had just
come through and they picked their way along
its edge, Tom and Garry on one bank and Doc
and Connie on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anyone&rsquo;s been in this place
in a thousand years; that&rsquo;s the way it looks to
me,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say at least three thousand,&rdquo; said
Garry.</p>
<p>Tom paid no attention. He had paused
and was holding his lantern over the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those four stones are in a pretty straight
line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you say that was a
ford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks more like a Buick to me,&rdquo; said Garry,
but he added, &ldquo;They <i>are</i> in a pretty straight
line. I guess it&rsquo;s a flivver, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look on that side,&rdquo; said Tom, to the
others. &ldquo;Do you see anything over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking carefully along the edge;
of the water when Doc called suddenly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here with your light, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Garry crossed, stepping from
stone to stone, and presently all four were
kneeling and examining in the lantern light
one of those commonplace things which sometimes
send a thrill over the discoverer&mdash;a human
footprint. There upon that lonesome
mountain, surrounded by the all but impenetrable
forest, was that simple, half-obliterated
but unmistakable token of a human presence.
Tom thought he knew now how Robinson
Crusoe felt when he found the footprint in the
sand.</p>
<p>The exposed roots of a tree formed ridges
in the hard bank, where footprints seemed
quite impossible of detection, and it was in
vain that the boys sought for others. Yet
here was this one, and so plain as to show the
criss-cross markings of a new sole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from a rubber boot,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be <i>some</i> signs of others
even if they&rsquo;re not as clear as this one,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;Maybe whoever was wearing that
boot slipped off one of those stones and got
it wet. That&rsquo;s why it printed, probably.
Anyway, somebody crossed here and they
were going up that way, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood staring at the footprint, thoroughly
sobered by its discovery. They had
penetrated into this rugged mountain in the
hope of finding some one, but the remoteness
and wildness of the place had grown upon
them and the whole chaotic scene seemed so
ill-associated with the presence of a human being
that now that they had actually found this
silent token it almost shocked them.</p>
<div class="img" id="p077">
<img src="images/p077.jpg" alt="PRESENTLY ALL FOUR WERE EXAMINING&mdash;A HUMAN FOOTPRINT." width="500" height="778" />
<p class="center">PRESENTLY ALL FOUR WERE EXAMINING&mdash;A HUMAN FOOTPRINT.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the wind was wrong before,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say we call again&mdash;all together?
There don&rsquo;t seem to be any path
leading anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They formed their hands into megaphones,
calling loud and long, but there was no answer
save a long drawn out echo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and louder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Once more their voices rose in such stentorian
chorus that it left them breathless and
Connie&rsquo;s head was throbbing as from a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;Shhh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From somewhere far off came a sound, thin
and spent with the distance, which died away
and seemed to mingle with the voice of the
breeze; then absolute silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a tree-toad,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>They waited a minute to give the answering
call a rest, if indeed it came from human lips,
then raised their voices once again in a long
<i>Helloo</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear it?&rdquo; whispered Connie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over
there to the east. That&rsquo;s no tree-toad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the sound was, the distance was
far too great for the sense of any call to be
understood. The voice was impersonal,
vague, having scarce more substance than a
dream, but it thrilled the four boys and made
them feel as if the living spirit of that footprint
at their feet was calling to them out of
the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even still I think it must be near the
stream though it sounds way off there,&rdquo; Tom
pointed; &ldquo;we might head straight for the
sound or we might follow the stream up. It
may go in that direction up a ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They decided to trust to the brook&rsquo;s guidance
and to the probability of its verging in
the direction of the sound. It wound its way
through intertwined and over-arching thickets
where they were forced to use their belt-axes
to chop their way through. Now and again
they called as they made their difficult way,
challenged almost at every step by obstructions.
But they heard no answering voice.</p>
<p>After a while the path became less difficult;
the very stream seemed to breathe easier
as it flowed through a comparatively open
stretch, and the four boys, torn and panting,
plodded along, grateful for the relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Look, do you
see a streak of white way ahead&mdash;just between
those trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; panted Connie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tent, I guess&mdash;thank
goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call again,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>There was no answer and they plodded on,
stooping under low-hanging or broken
branches, stepping cautiously over wet stones
and picking their way over great masses of
jagged rock. Never before had they beheld
a scene of such wild confusion and desolation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Tom, turning back
where he stood upon a great rock and holding
his lantern above a crevice. &ldquo;I thought I saw
something white down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered about him and looked down
into a fissure at a sight which unnerved them
all, scouts though they were. For there,
wedged between the two converging walls of
rock and plainly visible in the moonlight was
a skeleton, the few brown stringing remnants
depending from it unrecognizable as clothing.</p>
<p>Tom reached down and touched it with his
belt-axe, and it collapsed and fell rattling into
the bed of the cleft. He held his lantern
low for a moment and gazed down into the
crevice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some spooky place, believe <i>me</i>,&rdquo;
shivered Connie. &ldquo;Who do you suppose it
was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>A little farther on they came upon something
which apparently explained the presence
of the skeleton. As they neared the spot
where they had seen what they thought to be
a tent among the trees, they stopped aghast
at seeing among the branches of several elms
that most pathetic and complete of all wrecks,
the tattered, twisted remnants of a great aeroplane.
A few silken shreds were blowing
about the broken frame and beating against
the network of disordered wires and splintered
wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN SHELTER</span></h2>
<p>For a few moments they stared at the
wreck and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Kinney,&rdquo; suggested Doc, at
last. &ldquo;Do you remember about Kinney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Tom.</p>
<p>Half reluctantly the others followed him,
glancing back now and again till the tattered
mass became a shadowy speck and faded away
in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He started from somewhere above Albany,&rdquo;
said Doc, &ldquo;and he was never heard of
again. I often heard my father speak about
it and I read about it in that aviation book
that Roy loaned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to loan it to me when he gets
it back from you,&rdquo; said Connie; &ldquo;he says
you&rsquo;re a good bookkeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put away your little hammer,&rdquo; laughed
Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some people in Poughkeepsie thought
they heard the humming of the engine at
night,&rdquo; said Doc, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s what made people
think he had got past that point&mdash;but that&rsquo;s
all they ever knew. Some thought he must
have gone down in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was it?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<p>Tom plodded on silently. It was well
known of Tom that he could not think of two
things at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five or six years, I think,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be too long a time for the
wreck, seeing the condition it&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; said Garry,
&ldquo;but anything less than that would be
too short a time for the skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean they were lost here at different
times?&rdquo; Connie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are buzzards up here a skeleton
might look like that in a month or so,&rdquo; Connie
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any buzzards around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there are,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;Look at
Buzzard&rsquo;s Bay&mdash;it&rsquo;s named for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s named for a man who had it wished on
him,&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;You might as well say
that Pike&rsquo;s Peak was named after the pikers
that go there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose that aeroplane&rsquo;s
been there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five or six years, maybe,&rdquo; Doc said. &ldquo;The
frame&rsquo;ll be as good as that for ten years more.
There&rsquo;s nothing more to rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Garry, &ldquo;it looks to my keen
scout eye as if that wreck had been there for
about six months and the skeleton for about
six years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if you had tried shutting your
keen scout eye and opening it in a hurry&mdash;&mdash; Hey,
Tomasso?&rdquo; teased Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they got here at the same time but
the man lived for a while,&rdquo; Tom condescended
to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it just the wrong way round,
my fraptious boy,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;The skeleton&rsquo;s
been here longer, if anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that hickory stick there&mdash;all
worm-eaten?&rdquo; Tom asked. &ldquo;It had some
carving on it. None of these trees are hickory
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it but I didn&rsquo;t notice the carving,&rdquo;
said Doc, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you notice there weren&rsquo;t any hickory
trees anywhere around there?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;m a punk scout&mdash;I must
be blind,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good on first-aid,&rdquo; said Tom, indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know it was hickory?&rdquo; Connie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can tell hickory,&rdquo; said Tom,
bluntly, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s being all worm-eaten proved
it&mdash;kind of. That&rsquo;s the trouble with hickory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They always had to make the best of Tom&rsquo;s
answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he got the hickory
stick,&rdquo; he said, as he pushed along through the
underbrush, &ldquo;but he didn&rsquo;t get it anywhere
around here, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he probably didn&rsquo;t sit down that
same day and carve things on it, either,&rdquo; suggested
Garry; &ldquo;Tom, you&rsquo;re a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have lived up here for two or
three years after he fell,&rdquo; said Doc reflectively.
&ldquo;Gee, it starts you thinking, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connie shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery, all
right,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The thought of the solitary man, disabled
crippled, perhaps, living there on that lonely
mountain after the terrible accident which
had brought him there lent a new gruesomeness
to their discoveries. And who but Tom
Slade would have been able to keep an open
mind and to see so clearly by the aid of trifling
signs as to separate the two apparent
catastrophes and see them as independent
occurrences?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomasso, you&rsquo;re the real scout,&rdquo; said Doc.
&ldquo;The rest of us are only imitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom said nothing. He was used to this
kind of talk and was about as proof against
such praise as a battleship is against a popgun.
And just now he was thinking of other things.
Yet if he could have looked into the future
and seen there the extraordinary explanation
of his discovery and known the strange adventures
it would lead to, he might have paused,
even on that all but hopeless errand of rescue,
and looked again at those pathetic remains.
But those things were to be reserved for another
summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything we can do? What do
you suggest, Tom?&rdquo; Garry asked, dropping his
half flippant manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s shout again,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We
must be nearly a mile farther on by now, and
the brook&rsquo;s getting around to the east, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good and loud,&rdquo; said Connie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All together&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again their voices woke the mountain
echoes. A sudden rustling of the underbrush
told of some frightened wood creature. The
brook rippled softly as before. There was
no other sound, and they waited. Then, from
somewhere far off came the faint answering
of a human voice. It would never have been
distinguishable save in that deathlike stillness
and even there it sounded as if it might have
come from another world. It seemed to be
uttering the letter L in a kind of doleful
monotony.</p>
<p>They paused a moment in a kind of awe,
even after it had ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s calling <i>help</i>,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go there now,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The brook
probably winds around that way, but we can
cut across and get there quicker. We&rsquo;ll chop
our way through here. Let him rest his
lungs now&mdash;I can go right for a ways. I got
to admit I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>In the dim light of the lantern Garry
looked at Tom as he stood there, his heavy,
stolid face scratched by the brambly thicket,
his coarse shirt torn, his thick shock of hair
down over his forehead&mdash;no more elated by
triumph than he would have been discouraged
by defeat, and as the brighter, more vivacious
and attractive boy looked at him he was seized
with a little twinge of remorse that he had
made game of Tom&rsquo;s clumsy speech and sober
ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to admit you were wrong <i>how</i>&mdash;for
goodness&rsquo; sake?&rdquo; he said, almost angrily.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you bring us here? Didn&rsquo;t you bring
us all the way from Temple Camp to where
we could hear that voice calling for help?
Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I could find the trees that had the
stalking marks last summer,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and
I got to admit I was wrong, &rsquo;cause I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it that wouldn&rsquo;t sit down and
eat supper while somebody was dying?&rdquo; demanded
Doc. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole lot of good
scouts, believe <i>me</i>, but there&rsquo;s only one Tom
Slade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always the way&mdash;they made fun of
him and lauded him by turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kind of trail here,&rdquo; said Tom,
unmoved, &ldquo;but it hasn&rsquo;t been used for a long
time&mdash;see those spider webs across it? Lend
me your axe, will you, mine is all dulled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>A hand-to-hand combat with more tangled
underbrush, which they tore and chopped
away, brought them to comparatively open
land which must have been very high for
they were surprised to see, far below, several
twinkling specks of light which they thought
to be at Temple Camp. It was the first open
view they had had.</p>
<p>They called again, and again the voice answered,
clearly audible now, crying, &ldquo;Help
help!&rdquo; and something more which the boys
could not understand. They called, telling
the speaker not to come in search of them, that
they would come to him, and to answer them
for guidance when they called.</p>
<p>They plunged into more thicket, tearing it
aside with a will, sometimes going astray, then
pausing to listen for the guiding voice, and
pushing on again through the labyrinth.</p>
<p>After a little they fell into a path and then
could hear the brook rushing over stones not
far distant, and knew that it must verge to the
east as Tom had said and that the path did
lead to it. It would have been a long journey
following the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Soon a greater intercourse of speech was
possible and they called cheerily that they
were scouts and for the waiter to cheer up for
they would soon be with him.</p>
<p>Presently, along the path they could hear
the sound of footsteps. Tom, who was leading
the way, raised his lantern and just beyond
the radius of its flickering light they
could see a dark figure hurrying toward them;
then a face, greatly distraught in the moonlight,
and Tom stopped, bewildered. As the
stranger grasped his arm he held the light
close to the haggard, wild-eyed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I know you.
Let go&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter? Weren&rsquo;t you at
Temple Camp last summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger, a young fellow of perhaps
eighteen, shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With one of the troops from&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmn,&rdquo; said Tom, still holding the lantern
up; &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you fellows remember
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connie shook his head; Garry also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him in my life,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmn,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Maybe I&mdash;&mdash;just for
a minute I thought&mdash;&mdash;I guess you fellows
are right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The stranger was dressed in the regulation
camping outfit&mdash;the kind of costume usually
seen on dummies in the windows of sporting
goods stores in the spring, with a spick and
span tent in the background, a model lunch
basket near by and a canoe crowded in. His
nobby outfit was very much the worse for
wear, however, and he looked about as fresh
as the immaculate Phoebe Snow would look
after a <i>real</i> railroad journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can be rescued now,&rdquo; he said
imploringly, clinging to Tom. &ldquo;I saw the
lights way down there. There was only one
till tonight and tonight I counted seven&mdash;little
bits of ones. I tried to get to them, but I got
lost. You can&rsquo;t go to them. It looks as if
you can, but you can&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re just as far
away, no matter how far you go&mdash;they get
farther and farther. Nobody can ever get
away from here. Are you afraid of dead
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re scouts. Is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a person looks very different, then he&rsquo;s
dead, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get off this hill; I&rsquo;ve tried
every way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we will,&rdquo; spoke up Garry, putting
his arm over the boy&rsquo;s shoulder and urging
him along.</p>
<p>They could see that he was hardly rational,
and Garry, better than any of the others, knew
how to handle him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible without a light,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
spilled all the oil&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got a
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey Waring&mdash;come on, I&rsquo;ll show you
the place.&rdquo; He shuddered as he spoke.</p>
<p>Once more Tom held his lantern up to the
white, distracted face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> was never at camp,&rdquo; laughed Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmn,&rdquo; said Tom, apparently but half convinced.</p>
<p>A few steps brought them to a little clearing
where stood a rough shack. Outside it,
fastened against a tree, was a vegetable crate
with bars nailed across it&mdash;the silent evidence
of departed pets. Several fishing rods lay
against a tree. Close by was a makeshift fireplace.
On a rough bunk inside the shack lay
a man, no longer young, with iron gray hair.
His eyes were open and staring and one seemed
larger than the other. Doc felt his pulse and
found that he was living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He fell on the rocks and hurt his arm&mdash;I
think it&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; said Jeffrey. &ldquo;It bled and
I bandaged it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc raised the bandaged arm and it fell
heavily. Removing the bandage carefully he
saw that the cut itself was not dangerous, but
from first-aid studies he thought the man was
suffering from an apoplectic stroke or something
of that nature. He wondered if the injury
to the arm had not been incidental to
the man&rsquo;s seizure and sudden fall. People
sometimes lingered in an unconscious condition
for days, he knew. It was hardly a case
for first-aid, but it was certainly a case for
skill and resource, for whatever happened the
patient, dead or living, would have to be taken
away from this mountain camp.</p>
<p>With Garry&rsquo;s help, he raised the victim into
a recumbent posture, piling everything
available under the head while Connie hurried
back and forth to the brook, bringing wet applications
for the head and neck.</p>
<p>There was no sign of returning consciousness
and the question was how to get the patient
away down to Temple Camp where medical
aid might be had, and where any contingency
might be best handled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>The four boys, greatly hampered in their
discussion by Jeffrey, whose long vigil had
brought him to the verge of collapse, decided
that it would be quite useless to signal for help,
since it would mean another expedition with
most of the difficulties of their own, even if
attempted after daybreak.</p>
<p>So they decided to wait for dawn, which
happily would come soon, and with the first
sign of it to send a smudge signal that they
were coming and to have a doctor at camp.
They believed that in the daylight they could
carry the patient back over the same path
which they had so laboriously opened and
though delay was irksome this plan seemed
the only feasible one to follow.</p>
<p>Despite their weariness none could sleep,
so they kindled a little fire and sat about it
chatting while they counted time, impatiently
waiting for the first streak of daylight.</p>
<p>It was then that they learned from the overwrought
boy something of his history, but
they got it piecemeal and had to patch together
as best they could his rather disjointed
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he your father?&rdquo; Doc asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s my uncle,&rdquo; said Jeffrey. &ldquo;He
isn&rsquo;t a real governor; I only call him that.
He&rsquo;s eccentric&mdash;know what that is? If we
hadn&rsquo;t come trout fishing it would have been
all right. I could have sent my pigeons from
the boat&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a regular coop there&mdash;it
cost thirty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you like the stalking, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Connie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t be quiet enough&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
sneak up to them. You have to be quiet and
stealthy when you stalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made out that Mr. Waring was something
of a sportsman and was wealthy and
eccentric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live in a big house in Vale Centre,&rdquo;
Jeffrey told them, &ldquo;and we have fountains
and I have twenty-seven pigeons and two dogs&mdash;and
I can have anything I want except an
automobile. I can&rsquo;t have an automobile because
I&rsquo;m nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you live near Edgevale
Village, down the Hudson?&rdquo; Garry asked in
surprise. &ldquo;I live about two miles from the
Centre myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We live in a house that cost thousands and
thousands of dollars, but I like our boat best.
If there&rsquo;s a war we&rsquo;re going to give it to the
government, but if there isn&rsquo;t any war it&rsquo;s going
to be mine some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that Jeffrey and his uncle
lived alone, save for the servants, and had
cruised up the Hudson to Catskill Landing in
their boat for the trout fishing of which the
old gentleman was fond. How the pair had
happened to penetrate to this isolated spot
was not quite clear, but the boys gathered that
it had been a favorite haunt of Mr. Waring&rsquo;s
youthful days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he&rsquo;d bring me and show me,&rdquo;
said Jeffrey, &ldquo;and that we&rsquo;d stay here and
catch fish and I could send my pigeons back
to James&mdash;he&rsquo;s our chauffeur&mdash;and I&rsquo;d get
better so&rsquo;s I could remember things better.
Do you think you get better living in the
woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>The picture of the kindly old gentleman,
bringing his none too robust nephew to this
lonely spot, which lingered in his memory
perhaps as the scene of woodland sports of his
own boyhood, touched the four boys and
seemed to bring them in closer sympathy with
the figure that lay prone and motionless within
the little shack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can have anything I want,&rdquo; Jeffrey told
them again. &ldquo;Spotty cost fifty dollars, but he
died. That&rsquo;s because I was sick and my brain
didn&rsquo;t work good. My other carrier cost
thirty dollars and I sent him to James to tell
him the governor was hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts told him the fate of the pigeon
and of how they had received the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll never get away from here,&rdquo; Jeffrey
said hopelessly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never find our
way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the first light of dawn Garry increased
the dying blaze and sent the smudge signal.
Piling damp leaves on the fire he caused a
straight thin column of thick smoke to rise
high into the air and by inverting the deserted
pigeon coop over this, and removing and replacing
it as the Morse code required, he imprinted
against the vast gray dawn the words</p>
<p class="center">COMING HAVE DOCTOR</p>
<p>They knew well enough that some one in
the camp would keep sleepless vigil, watching
for just such a message. Three times the
words were spelled out in smoke to make sure
that they would be caught and understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>To Jeffrey, whose only resource had been
his pet pigeon and who had been unnerved by
his inability to find his way from the hill, the
sending of this message and the quiet orderly
preparations for departure which followed
were the cause of gaping amazement. He
clung to Garry, as the others got his uncle
onto the stretcher, and walked along at his
side, plying him with excited questions. Sometimes
it was necessary for him to take a corner
while one of the scouts went ahead to open
a way and then his panic was pitiable.</p>
<p>It did not seem at all peculiar to the others
that he should single out Garry and cling to
him, for everybody fell for Garry almost at
first sight. What they did notice was that he
appeared to shun Tom, who, indeed, was entitled
to all his gratitude and was the hero
of the occasion if anyone was.</p>
<p>But then he was a queer boy anyway, and
thoroughly shaken up by his experience.</p>
<p>As for Garry, the sudden hit which he had
apparently made quite amused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should worry,&rdquo; he said, laughingly
to Tom.</p>
<p>And Tom shrugged his shoulders and
smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;UNDER WHICH KING?&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And, oh it was great the way you sent that signal. Gee,
a smudge message is no
cinch&mdash;I always said so. You can talk about
your wireless and your wigwagging and semaphoring
and fire signalling and all, but you
got to admit smudging is hardest of all&mdash;gee,
you got to admit that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy as pie,&rdquo; said one of the group,
making an imposing smudge upon Gordon
Lord&rsquo;s round face by way of proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; continued Gordon, calmly wiping
his cheek, &ldquo;because you can&rsquo;t shut it off
so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like you, hey, kiddo?&rdquo; smiled
his tall friend, Arnold, who stood near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to read,&rdquo; Gordon went on, undaunted,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s even harder to send. Of
course, even if it had mistakes, <i>he</i> could read
it,&rdquo; he added, indicating Harry Arnold, &ldquo;because
he can do pretty nearly anything. But
you sure are a peach of a scout&mdash;gee, I got
to admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Having thus delivered his verdict, he gave
a tug to his stocking which had a way of slipping
down, as one might say, whenever his
back was turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scout&rsquo;s got to be magmanigous,&rdquo; he concluded,
as he tugged up the other stocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thank you for the compliment,&rdquo;
laughed Garry Everson, &ldquo;undeserved though
it be. I think the skill is always on the receiving
end but we won&rsquo;t quarrel about it,&rdquo;
he added, turning to Arnold.</p>
<p>Little Raymond Hollister clung to Garry
as if he feared the crowd might kidnap him,
his face beaming with pride at all this praise
showered upon his hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were a patrol last year,&rdquo; he
ventured, &ldquo;he received them as well as sent
them. Anybody that was here last summer
can tell you how he saved a fellow&rsquo;s life,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it was one of our troop that bandaged
him,&rdquo; piped up Pee-wee Harris of the
Silver Foxes; &ldquo;it was Doc Carson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lose your reputation,&rdquo; someone
laughed at Arnold, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, watch your rep when the Bridgeboro
Sprouts get started,&rdquo; said Roy Blakeley.
&ldquo;I guess we better put them to bed now, hadn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; he asked, winking at Jeb Rushmore.
&ldquo;The trouble with this blamed camp is, there
are too many heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anybody here can beat Harry
being a hero!&rdquo; Gordon bristled, in prompt defense
of his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there is,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Gordon demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Fat Burns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, put some on the fire and see,&rdquo; said
Roy.</p>
<p>Gordon ignored the laugh at his expense.
&ldquo;Even girls say so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Gee, I hope a
girl knows a hero when she sees one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Raymond, still keeping close to Garry,
laughed silently, but he did not venture
again into the arena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon the real hero o&rsquo; this here business
ain&rsquo;t said nuthin&rsquo;? and ain&rsquo;t hed nuthin&rsquo; said
fur him, this far,&rdquo; drawled Jeb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; said Doc Carson. &ldquo;Tomasso
Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou never spakest a truer word,&rdquo; said
Roy.</p>
<p>Tom stood among them, his hair still
frowzled, his faded gray shirt torn, his belt
drawn much tighter than necessary, and a disfiguring
scratch across his rather lowering
countenance. He did not look at all like the
scouts on the cover of <i>Boy&rsquo;s Life</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as anybody&rsquo;s a hero in particular,&rdquo;
he said, disconcerted at being brought
into the limelight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&rsquo;s you can be
a hero just climbing up a hill. That&rsquo;s all we
did. That girl in the munition factory that
stayed at her telephone when the shells were
flying around&mdash;she was what I call a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a shero, Tomasso,&rdquo; corrected Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Hobson was a hero, too,&rdquo; Tom
added soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied to be at the
head of my patrol and be a first class
scout&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to have the gold cross,&rdquo; someone interrupted,
referring to his winning of this
coveted medal the previous summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve got that,
too,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;Maybe if we get into a war
with Germany we&rsquo;ll have a chance to be
heroes, for sure&mdash;like the English scouts. I
ain&rsquo;t neutral, anyway. I ain&rsquo;t neutral any more
since last Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was exactly like Tom to announce his
repudiation of neutrality in this sudden fashion
and in face of his scoutmaster&rsquo;s admonition
that all the troop should honor the President&rsquo;s
express wish. It was also exactly like
him to begin on one subject and to end with
some blunt announcement on another. His
mention of &ldquo;last Tuesday&rdquo; referred to the
torpedoing of a ship by a German submarine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
who understood him perfectly, &ldquo;but we
mustn&rsquo;t shout about it, you know, because
we&rsquo;re not in the war&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torpedoing&rsquo;s kind of like hitting below
the belt,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but that ain&rsquo;t what I
wanted to say. I didn&rsquo;t say anything about
that fellow till they took his uncle away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Jeffrey here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;because it didn&rsquo;t seem right&mdash;sort
of. But now he&rsquo;s here alone with us, I suppose
he&rsquo;ll join one of the troops and I&rsquo;d like
to have him join my patrol because I need
one more member and I think he&rsquo;ll be good
on stalking and I want a stalking badge in
my patrol. Maybe he could come back and
live in Bridgeboro somewhere if his uncle
should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, quick
to prevent him from finishing his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean I want it just as a reward&mdash;&rsquo;cause
I don&rsquo;t think I did anything special.
But I got just one more member to get
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight movement in the group
and Jeffrey Waring brushed past the others
and grasped Garry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be in <i>his</i> club,&rdquo; said he, looking
almost imploringly at Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;I
want to join <i>his</i> class; he can send a message
even better than a pigeon can take it, and it&rsquo;s
<i>sure</i> to get there. He can do it just with
smoke. I want to join <i>his</i> class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was greatly excited, as he always became
when he talked and Garry winking
significantly at the Bridgeboro Troop&rsquo;s scoutmaster,
strolled away with Jeffrey clinging to
him and Raymond following.</p>
<p>Tom Slade stood motionless, stolid, and said
not a word. Then, in a moment, Roy Blakeley
went over and stood beside him, resting his
arm on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Once, a couple of years before, when Tom
was a hoodlum and John Temple was an old
grouch, the capitalist had strode down through
a field where Tom was trespassing, shouting
threats and imprecations at the waif, whose
first impulse was to run. Turning to do so,
he had found Roy Blakeley, scout, standing by
him, and had felt Roy&rsquo;s arm on his shoulder.
And Tom Slade, hoodlum, did not run.
Goodness, it seems like ancient history now,
with Tom head of a patrol and &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo;
Temple founder and trustee of the big Temple
Camp!</p>
<p>But Mr. Ellsworth and Doc Carson and
Westy and others of the Ravens and Silver
Foxes, remembered, and they noticed how
Roy Blakeley stepped forward now and put
his arm over Tom&rsquo;s shoulder, just as he had
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> should worry, Tomasso,&rdquo; they heard
him say in an undertone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">JEFFREY WARING</span></h2>
<p>The scene just described was in the Pow-wow
Circle, as they called the open space
where the camp fire burned by night at Temple
Camp. After a difficult descent of the
hill the boys had been met at the wood&rsquo;s edge
by Jeb with more scouts, a couple of visiting
scoutmasters and a physician from the not far
distant village. To Jeffrey, whose poor efforts
had been so futile and bewildering, this
orderly sequel to Garry&rsquo;s smudge signal was
nothing less than a miracle, and he gazed at
the party from camp as if they had dropped
from the clouds.</p>
<p>Despite their burden and the special caution
which had been necessary in picking their
way down, the descent had been easier than
the laborious journey in the dark the night
before, but it was long past noontime when
they emerged at the edge of the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Perhaps it was natural that Jeffrey, not
knowing of that battle with the thicket and
the darkness should have seen the signalling
as the most astonishing feat, and since Doc had
assumed responsibility for his injured uncle
and in a way superintended the descent, perhaps
it was natural too that the first-aid boy,
who received a flattering comment from the
real doctor, should come second to Garry in
his estimation. Whatever his peculiarities,
he certainly did not stint his hero-worship.
But Tom he disregarded altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why that is?&rdquo; said Gordon
Lord, of the First Oakwood, N. J., Troop,
talking the thing over with Honorable Pee-wee
Harris, of Bridgeboro. &ldquo;Do you know
why that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pee-wee couldn&rsquo;t guess, but he hazarded
the observation that Jeffrey was a kind of a
<i>nut</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because Tom Slade doesn&rsquo;t wear any
uniform,&rdquo; said Gordon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the uniform that
gets people&mdash;specially girls. Gee, they all fall
for the uniform&mdash;everybody does. You
wouldn&rsquo;t catch <i>me</i> going without it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why Tom doesn&rsquo;t wear one,&rdquo;
said Pee-wee. &ldquo;But even if he did I don&rsquo;t
think girls would notice him much&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t
that kind. He&rsquo;s kind of clumsy, like. He
worked after school all winter and he must
have got a lot of money saved up, but when
Roy asked him if he wasn&rsquo;t going to get a suit
and things, he said he wasn&rsquo;t going to bother&mdash;he
was more comfortable that way. We all
got new outfits this year. Mr. Ellsworth says
Tom&rsquo;s a kind of a law inside himself&mdash;or something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It troubled Gordon that a boy who could do
the things Tom had done should eschew the
khaki regalia, the hanging jack knife, the belt
axe and the scarf, and he spoke to Roy about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me, kiddo,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;He ought
to have forty-&rsquo;leven dollars and some trading
stamps saved up. He&rsquo;s a thrifty soul and he
sold the <i>Friday Evening Pest</i> all winter. It&rsquo;s
got me guessing. Maybe he&rsquo;s sending it to
Belgium&mdash;he&rsquo;s come out strong for the Allies
now. He&rsquo;s a sketch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor had shaken his head when he
looked at Mr. Waring, and said that his life
was hanging on a thread, and that the thread
was pretty sure to break. They took him to
the little hospital in the village and from
there telegraphed to his home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>On the doctor&rsquo;s suggestion, seconded by Jeb
and the scoutmasters, the boy was kept at
camp awaiting developments, and it was well
toward evening of that first Sunday while
they were waiting for supper, that the tension
and suspense relaxed somewhat in this general
talk which had ended in Jeffrey&rsquo;s impulsive
and rather surprising act.</p>
<p>To the great delight of Raymond the
strange boy was allowed to bunk in the little
cabin with himself and Garry, where he spent
practically the whole of the next day watching
Garry unpack his luggage and reading the
Scout Handbook, turning more than once to
the chapter about signalling, which he seemed
to regard as a sort of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p>He made an aimless tour about the camp,
pausing here and there before tent or cabin
and chatting with the scouts who received him
kindly enough, listening to his rather rambling
talk and affecting an interest in the wealth and
especially the boat, of which he was never
weary of boasting. He seemed fascinated
with this view of real camp life. What the
boys really thought of him it would be hard
to say, but they were for the most part indulgent
and if there were a few who yielded to
the temptation to jolly him, they were promptly
discouraged by the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>For Garry, however, there was less patience
and Jeffrey more than once felt moved to
defend his hero against the plainer sort of
abuse. The sarcastic references to his chosen
friend he did not quite appreciate.</p>
<p>Garry, indeed, was paying dearly (especially
at the hands of the Bridgeboro Troop) for
his act of walking away with Jeffrey to the
humiliation and disappointment of Tom
Slade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one scout, who was raising the
patrol pennant outside his cabin as Jeffrey
came along, &ldquo;how do you think you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you signal?&rdquo; Jeffrey asked, as if
that were really the important subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so worse at it,&rdquo; the scout replied,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not much good as a kidnapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey did not catch the sense of this. He
looked at the boy for a moment and then
strolled on, pausing in front of the Silver
Fox&rsquo;s cabin, where Roy Blakeley, Pee-wee
Harris, and others of that notoriously flippant
patrol were building a couple of balsam beds
outside, for the overflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning glory,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do drop&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way you
should answer him,&rdquo; said Pee-wee; &ldquo;come
right back at him&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him get away
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey stared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thick one,&rdquo;
he said, referring to a branch Roy was about
to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it was brought up on oatmeal,&rdquo; said
Roy. &ldquo;Stand from under!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey hastened to get out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is it?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout as long as a short circuit,&rdquo; said
Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it&rsquo;s a beautiful afternoon this morning,&rdquo;
said Roy. &ldquo;Well, you got wished onto
the large Edgevale Patrol, hey? Three
members. <i>Some</i> patrol!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose cabin is that next one?&rdquo; Jeffrey
asked irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? That&rsquo;s Mr. Rushmore&rsquo;s cabin.
He has charge of the grounds&mdash;all of &rsquo;em,
even the coffee grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Jeffrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the next cabin,&rdquo; said Roy, &ldquo;belongs
to the Elks&mdash;Tom Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him so much,&rdquo; said Jeffrey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, hey? Well, you might have
got into a <i>regular</i> patrol,&rdquo; said Roy, busy with
his work. &ldquo;It was up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not having been of the party which rescued
Jeffrey, and hence not having had the same
opportunity to observe him, Roy was not as
patient with him as some of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he demanded,
wheeling about and becoming serious.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who you&rsquo;ve got to thank
for getting you out of your scrape? Don&rsquo;t
you know who saved you from starving up
there? What&rsquo;s the matter with you, anyway?
I know fellows who&rsquo;d be glad of the
chance to get into the Elk Patrol. They&rsquo;ve
got the gold cross in that patrol, let me tell
you&mdash;and <i>sixteen merit badges</i>! And <i>you</i>,
like a big chump, pass it up, and run after
that pair that isn&rsquo;t any patrol at all! Let me
tell you something, my fraptious boy, in case
you should ever get to be a scout&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> a scout,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, and doubtless
he thought he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little old book with a red cover
you&rsquo;ve got to take a squint into before you&rsquo;re
a B. S., let me tell you. And it&rsquo;s got some
good dope about making sacrifices and being
generous and you can&rsquo;t be a good scout walking
away with somebody else&rsquo;s prize&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t! You tell your patrol leader, or whatever
you call him, to look in that little old
Handbook and see if he finds anything there
that&rsquo;ll give him the right to put one over on
the fellow that found you and brought you
here; and the fellow that saved his own life,
too! Hand me that other branch, Pee-wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey could only stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that cross solid gold?&rdquo; he finally asked,
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;14 carrots&mdash;a couple of turnips and
a few potatoes. Stand out of the way, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey made way for Westy Martin, who
was tugging a balsam branch to Roy. Then
he moved away together.</p>
<p>Outside the Elks&rsquo; cabin was Dory Bronson,
spearing papers, for the Elks were a tidy
lot and took great pride in their surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a game?&rdquo; Jeffrey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sister Anne,&rdquo; said Dory. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
going to be the name of your patrol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to have a name?&rdquo; asked
Jeffrey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sure do. I was thinking &lsquo;magpie&rsquo;
would be a good one. They usually get everything
in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey was not good at repartee; he did
not understand these boys and he could not
cope with them. Much less did he understand
the wholesome spirit of rivalry and of
loyalty which now made Garry an outsider&mdash;ostracized
for what the whole camp regarded
as a piece of selfishness and unfairness.
His winking at Mr. Ellsworth as he
walked away with his new recruit was taken
as a deliberate attempt to flaunt his triumph.</p>
<p>Some said he had changed since the previous
summer. There were a few who said it
was natural, perhaps, that he should have
taken the strange boy under his wing so
promptly, seeing that their homes were not
far apart. But everyone agreed that by all the
rules of the game Jeffrey should have gone
with Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We asked Garry to go up the hill with
us that night,&rdquo; said Connie Bennet, &ldquo;even
though he isn&rsquo;t in our troop, just because we
liked him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we stopped at Edgevale and brought
him along in the <i>Good Turn</i>,&rdquo; said Will Bronson,
&ldquo;even though we were crowded already.
And now he puts one over on us like that!
<i>He&rsquo;s</i> a fine scout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only you have to say it quick to keep from
choking!&rdquo; added Roy, who had stopped before
the Elks cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure got away with it,&rdquo; added Connie.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got this Jeffrey, or whatever his name
is, eating out of his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should worry,&rdquo; said Roy, as he
strolled on.</p>
<p>The next day two men arrived in an automobile,
bringing with them the news that Jeffrey&rsquo;s
benefactor was dead. It cast a shadow
over the camp even among the many who had
not seen the injured man. The boy himself
was greatly distressed, wringing his hands
like a child, and clinging to Garry.</p>
<p>One of these gentlemen was Mr. Waring&rsquo;s
executor, the other a friend, and since both of
them lived in Poughkeepsie, which was the
nearest city to Edgevale, neither knew much
about Mr. Waring&rsquo;s home life. They agreed
with Mr. Ellsworth that it would be in all
ways best for this unfortunate nephew, who
seemed to be Mr. Waring&rsquo;s only survivor, to
remain where he was, and accept the hospitality
of the camp until his uncle&rsquo;s affairs
could be settled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can I stay with Garry and Raymond and
be in their club and take them out in my
boat?&rdquo; Jeffrey asked, excitedly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mine
now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you boys will have to settle that
among yourselves,&rdquo; said the executor; &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t know about the boat,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Undoubtedly
it will be yours, but you mustn&rsquo;t
try to run it by yourself. It would be all right
to use it if these gentlemen (turning to Mr.
Ellsworth and one of the camp trustees) will
take charge of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry understands marine engines,&rdquo; Raymond
ventured timidly to the visitors, whom
the boys had just been showing about the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, is he after the boat, too?&rdquo; sneered
Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t after the boat!&rdquo; Raymond
flared back; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s got a uniform and that&rsquo;s
more than <i>your</i> patrol leader has!&rdquo; he added
irrelevantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Garry quieted Raymond and the others
laughed. No one had any resentment against
<i>him</i>, nor much against Jeffrey, for whom
they made full allowance, but Garry was
ignored, and this was the unhappy sequel of
his friendship with the Bridgeboro boys and
of the expedition which he had made with
three of them up the wooded hill.</p>
<p>It was not the policy of Jeb Rushmore nor
of the scoutmasters and trustees to seek to adjust
differences between the scouts and so the
golden days (which were all too fleeting for
quarrels and bad-feeling) were clouded by
this estrangement.</p>
<p>At last, one day, Harry Arnold took it
upon himself to go to Garry&rsquo;s cabin and talk
with him. He, at least, had not altogether
shunned Garry and he felt free to approach
him. He found him teaching Jeffrey to carve
designs on a willow stick by artistic removal
of the bark. Raymond was making birchbark
ornaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Garry; &ldquo;want to join the kindergarten
class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jeff, old scout!&rdquo; said Arnold, slapping
him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Hello, Raymond,
how&rsquo;s the giant of the Hudson Highlands?
I thought I&rsquo;d drop around and see if you were
still alive&mdash;you stay by yourselves so much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not exactly what you&rsquo;d call popular,&rdquo;
said Garry, smiling a little. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the
birthday celebration coming on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell. I understand Slade&rsquo;s own patrol
is going to give him one of those bugles that&rsquo;s
advertised in <i>Scouting</i>&mdash;so he can blow himself,
Blakeley says&mdash;with a fancy cord and
tassels and the names of all his patrol engraved
on it. Too bad he hasn&rsquo;t got a full
patrol. Just one more name and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the camp going to give him?&rdquo; interrupted
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp is going to give him a wireless
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach, too! Did you hear what
Jeb&rsquo;s going to give him? An elk&rsquo;s head&mdash;gee,
you ought to see the antlers on it. He wrote
to some ranch or other away out in Montana
to send it. He shot the elk himself. Roosevelt
told him it was one of the finest he ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to know,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you said something! It&rsquo;ll
be appropriate, hey&mdash;Elk Patrol. And, let&rsquo;s
see, the Bridgeboro Troop&rsquo;s going to give him
a high grade searchlight for tracking. Jeb
nearly fell off his grocery box when he heard
that! He thinks you ought to go blindfold
when you&rsquo;re tracking. Then there&rsquo;s a lot of
crazy stuff&mdash;that fellow Blakeley hasn&rsquo;t had
any sleep the last week thinking up fool things.
He&rsquo;s going to give Tom a cat&rsquo;s collar to use
for a belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one,&rdquo; laughed Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what all. Pee-wee
Harris is going to give him <i>Boy&rsquo;s Life</i>
for a year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Saturday, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Garry, indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Elks will be two years old. Blakeley
was telling me their whole history. You
don&rsquo;t mind if I sit down on these bricks, do
you. It&rsquo;s kind of damp on the ground. Do
all your own cooking here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, most of it. Make yourself at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make yourself homely, as Blakeley would
say,&rdquo; laughed Arnold, changing his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you fellows go and get some more
willow,&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Go ahead with what
you were saying,&rdquo; he added, as Raymond and
Jeffrey obediently started off toward the lake.
&ldquo;I was afraid you might say something that
I wouldn&rsquo;t want Jeff to hear. I have to be
awful careful with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer duck, isn&rsquo;t he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when you know how to handle him.
My father was a doctor and I&rsquo;ve often heard
him tell about people like that. I think he&rsquo;s
got what they call amnesia or something like
that. I&rsquo;ve a kind of a hunch that his&mdash;er,
this Mr. Waring took him up there in that
woods so&rsquo;s he could just live quiet and natural
like and maybe get better. I&rsquo;ve often heard
my father talk about the woods being a medicine
for the mind. Don&rsquo;t you remember
there was some old duffer of a king who was
cured that way&mdash;in some forest or other? I
guess Jeff&rsquo;s a whole lot better than he was
when he first came up here in the woods.
From little things he says sometimes, I guess
he was pretty bad at first. Ever take a flyer at
carving birchbark? Look here, what Jeff and
the kid have done. They&rsquo;re fiends at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold looked at Garry curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you about this Tom
Slade&mdash;this patrol business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m kind of an outsider&mdash;it&rsquo;s
none of my business&mdash;except that I happened
to be the one to get your smudge signal. But,
of course, I&rsquo;ve heard all about you and the
Bridgeboro fellows last year&mdash;what good
friends you were and all, and how Tom Slade
went up through that fire to your shack up
there, and it seems a blamed shame that you&rsquo;re
not good friends now. We&rsquo;re all here such
a short time anyway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Monday for us,&rdquo; said Garry, ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was thinking. The
birthday dinner, then Sunday and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be others here to take our places
though,&rdquo; finished Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was wondering,&rdquo; continued Arnold,
&ldquo;if we couldn&rsquo;t kind of straighten things up
before that. You know, ever since that first
night I&rsquo;ve sort of hung out with the Bridgeboro
fellows. Gordon and I are here on our
own hook and he sort of stands in with Pee-wee&mdash;and,
oh, I don&rsquo;t know, Tom and Blakeley
sort of got me. That first night when you
fellows were up the hill Blakeley spieled off
a lot of stuff at campfire. He told us all
about their trip up in the motor-boat last
year and about the fellow that used to own it&mdash;how
he lost his life. Funny though, how
that part of the rowboat got back to the
launch, wasn&rsquo;t it? I guess Tom&rsquo;s notion
doesn&rsquo;t amount to much, though. Anyway,
that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;our beloved scoutmaster&rsquo; as Roy
calls him, seems to think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ellsworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He says Tom&rsquo;s got a little vein of the
dime novel in him&mdash;&lsquo;Back From Death&rsquo; or
the &lsquo;Mystery of the Busted Dory&rsquo; as Roy says.
He calls Tom Sherlock Nobody Holmes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess nobody understands Tom Slade
very well,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose maybe that&rsquo;s just the reason the
troop makes such a lot of him. If you played&mdash;if
somebody played a mean trick on&mdash;on&mdash;Doc
Carson, for instance, the fellows wouldn&rsquo;t
be so sore about it. But when you put one
over on Tom you hit them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I play mean tricks?&rdquo; queried
Garry, beginning to carve a willow stick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that. But you can see Tom
is a favorite and anybody with two squinters
in his head, surely any scout, can see why.
He came out of the slums and he&rsquo;s poor and
in some ways he&rsquo;s different from these fellows.
They&rsquo;re all rich fellows and pretty well educated&mdash;you
know what I mean. They made
him a scout, and they&rsquo;re always on the watch
for fear he&rsquo;ll see some difference. They&rsquo;re
proud of him because he&rsquo;s made good and
they&rsquo;re going to see to it that the scouts make
good. They want him to have all that&rsquo;s coming
to him just because he hasn&rsquo;t got some
things that they&rsquo;ve got&mdash;you understand,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I come pretty near knowing what
it is to be poor,&rdquo; said Garry, whittling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, these fellows here have been pretty
decent to you, too, first and last, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; said Arnold,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every fellow has some kind of a bug. Pee-wee&rsquo;s
bug is good turns. Doc Carson&rsquo;s bug
is first-aid&mdash;honest, I believe that fellow&rsquo;d give
you a black eye just for the fun of putting a
bandage on it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> Gordon&rsquo;s bug. Tom&rsquo;s bug is that
poor fellow that&rsquo;s been dead two years&mdash;and
they kid the life out of him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; and your bug is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it to me gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bug is Raymond Hollister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting to be a strong, healthy bug,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just the reason you copped
this new fellow, Jeffrey. You wanted to please
Raymond. And you let them both think that
you&rsquo;re a patrol&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think maybe the fact that Jeffrey lives
near you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, I think maybe that has
something to do with it. But I&rsquo;m going to
pass you some straight talk, Everson, and I
don&rsquo;t want you to get mad. You know, Slade
is crazy about his patrol and by all the rules
of the game this fellow belongs with him.
He&rsquo;s nutty about his patrol, whereas you
haven&rsquo;t really any patrol at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why not let Tom have him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeffrey isn&rsquo;t a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but he&rsquo;ll do anything you tell him
is best for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s best for him to stay right
here where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arnold rose angrily. Garry went on
whittling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows are beginning to see you in
your true light, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Arnold. &ldquo;I
thought maybe they were mistaken but I guess
they&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re saying now that you did
Tom Slade out of the Silver Cross last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Tom say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of them do. Well, I don&rsquo;t see
as I can do much good staying here and talking.
What I came to ask you was if you didn&rsquo;t
think it would be a bully idea to turn Jeffrey
over to the Elks on Saturday&mdash;as a birthday
present to the patrol.&rdquo; Arnold waited a moment
hoping Garry would make some reply.
&ldquo;Tom found him&mdash;he plowed up through that
mess&mdash;Jeb calls it nature tied in a knot&mdash;it was
his idea and it was his job&mdash;and it&rsquo;s about all
he could be expected to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have more to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded Arnold, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a case
of rendering unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar&rsquo;s. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you fix it up with Jeffrey Waring to
join the Elks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>Arnold looked steadily at him for a moment,
then turned on his heel and strode away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A NEW KIND OF FIRST AID</span></h2>
<p>Garry sat outside the little makeshift shack
which he and Jeffrey and Raymond occupied,
and whittled as Arnold strode along the beaten
path toward the main body of camp. He was
still whittling when Raymond and Jeff returned
from the shore, their arms laden with
willow branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiddo,&rdquo; he said to Raymond, &ldquo;suppose
you get me that other shirt of yours and I&rsquo;ll
sew up that tear. I&rsquo;ve got to fix my own, too.
We&rsquo;re not very strong on clothes, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy us all clothes,&rdquo; put in Jeffrey.
&ldquo;When I get my own scout suit I&rsquo;ll get new
ones for you and Raymond&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have thousands
of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed Garry. &ldquo;You put
some water boiling now, while Raymond peels
the potatoes, so we can have grub. Then
come over here and talk to me while I do the
family mending.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Raymond busied himself with preparations
for supper and Jeffrey sat down on the ground
close to Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re here by ourselves, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to give you
two thousand dollars for letting me be in your
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see if you can&rsquo;t remember that
word <i>patrol</i> so I don&rsquo;t have to remind you.
And what was the other thing&mdash;just think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About money?&rdquo; asked Jeffrey, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Try to remember never to promise
people money&mdash;especially scouts&mdash;because
they don&rsquo;t like it. Now hand me that other
spool of thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s fine to be rich, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to be a scout. Any headache
today, Jeff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now see if you can remember how
many willow canes you&rsquo;ve carved altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. You&rsquo;re going to get the memory
badge pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they have a memory badge?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me what you and I and Raymond
did the day before yesterday&mdash;just before
grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Played mumbly-peg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not going to give you a
hundred dollars like I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it a thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was a hundred&mdash;you can&rsquo;t fool me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was it, kiddo?&rdquo; Garry called to
Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now see if you can remember
the first time you ever saw Tom Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s going to be the name of our&mdash;class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patrol,&rdquo; corrected Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tigers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what&mdash;you&rsquo;re getting to have a
crackerjack memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now turn your face around there so I
can see it by the light of the fire. Put some
more twigs on, kidlet, it&rsquo;s beginning to get
dark. I want to be able to see if you&rsquo;re just
joshing me. This is an important matter.
When I was up at commissary shack for salt
and things I was noticing the things on the
bulletin board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that about the Elks birthday party,&rdquo;
interrupted Jeffrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you see that one about the new
rowboat being in the lake and asking everybody
to vote on a name for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we go to that dinner party?&rdquo; Jeffrey
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; said Garry,
&ldquo;but anyway, we&rsquo;ll each of us vote a name for
the new boat and I&rsquo;ll drop them in the ballot
box up at camp in the morning. What do
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote &lsquo;Buster&rsquo;!&rdquo; called Raymond, who
was poking up the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Jeffrey, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those are two punk names! &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t so bad, but &lsquo;Buster&rsquo; suggests busting,
and a boat that would bust&mdash;go-o-dnight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Jeffrey stared at Garry. His face was right
in the glare of the fire and though his look
was of that vacant character which all the
boys had noticed, it seemed less pronounced
than it had been when he came to Temple
Camp. Perhaps the quiet, even life in the
solitude under these sheltering trees, with the
tranquil lake hard by, was really showing its
effect, as Mr. Waring had evidently hoped
that it would do; perhaps the wholesome
companionship of these other boys was already
beginning to tell; it was a new kind of First-Aid
at all events, and one quite outside of Doc
Carson&rsquo;s sphere. Or it may have been that
Jeffrey was just startled into a livelier interest,
as he had often been lately, at something
that was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Garry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you
my vote. And if there&rsquo;s a prize, I think I&rsquo;ll
win it. I vote to name the new dory&mdash;<i>Nymph</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on Garry with an
intense wondering stare and Garry, looking
quizzically at him, said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a peach of
a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;somebody else thought of
it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Jeffrey&rsquo;s utterance fizzled out in another
stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And speaking of boats, how about it, Jeff,
do you think you could walk as far as Catskill
Landing&mdash;seven full grown miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I can! Didn&rsquo;t I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, by jingoes, if tomorrow&rsquo;s clear,
we&rsquo;ll take that long promised hike&mdash;just you
and me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope&mdash;just you and me; and we&rsquo;ll have
a squint at that wonderful boat of yours, hey?
And then I&rsquo;ll show you the Bridgeboro
Troop&rsquo;s boat, even if we have to trespass, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey grew excited at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you sure you won&rsquo;t change
your mind?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows don&rsquo;t take any interest in
my boat,&rdquo; Jeffrey said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Garry, &ldquo;what was the
name of that game? I can&rsquo;t seem to remember
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumbly-peg,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use getting excited about
it,&rdquo; laughed Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE BIRTHDAY OF THE ELK PATROL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m not much of a cook, but I&rsquo;ll
make things hot for <i>you</i> if you don&rsquo;t get away
from here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy Blakeley, from the cooking lean-to,
despatched an eggplant (which had not stood
the physical test, as he said) straight at the
scampering form of Pee-wee Harris, who had
raided the sacred precincts of the larder for
raisins and was now departing with scurrilous
comments on his patrol leader. And the
eggplant, faithful to its trust, landed plunk
upon Pee-wee&rsquo;s round, curly head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plant that and raise some scrambled
eggs,&rdquo; Roy called after him.</p>
<p>Roy was assisting the camp cooks, for it
was the second anniversary of the forming of
the Elk Patrol, and there were to be &ldquo;doings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that kid had got a hair-cut when he
ought to have, he&rsquo;d have <i>felt</i> that eggplant.
That head of his is a regular shock absorber.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long is a hair-cut, anyway?&rdquo; queried
Roy, sitting on the table and stirring a bowl
of batter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind them riddles,&rdquo; said the
chief cook. &ldquo;You git that batter ready&mdash;pour
some more milk in from that pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have a batter and a pitcher both,
hey?&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;Pretty soon I&rsquo;ll have a
whole baseball team. But honest, this is what
I mean. A boy gets a hair-cut. Is it a hair-cut
the next day? It is a hair-cut the day
after? When does it stop being a hair-cut?
And here&rsquo;s another thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; laughed the cook.
&ldquo;You git that stirred and then I&rsquo;ll let you
make some raisin cakes&mdash;seein&rsquo; as you say you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Roy was busying himself in the
cooking lean-to other scouts were forming
the three mess-boards into one long table.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock, an hour earlier than usual,
the camp bugle sounded and patrols and
troops, in formation, marched from their
tents and cabins to the long board which was
heaped with such a varied and bountiful repast
as Temple Camp had never before seen.
It was a pleasant scene as the boys came with
their patrol pennants waving, and took their
allotted places at the long rustic table under
the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Jeb Rushmore sat at the head of the table,
one of the two visiting trustees on either hand.
The scoutmasters sat each with his troop, and
behind each patrol leader his staff bearing
the patrol pennant was stuck in the ground so
that one could easily distinguish the different
patrols. Scouts who were visiting camp
singly or in teams or small parties, like Harry
Arnold and his friend, were seated toward the
foot of the board. The three patrols of the
well-organized Bridgeboro Troop, the Ravens,
Silver Foxes and Elks, sat toward the
head of the table on either side, close to the
trustees. On the plate of each member of
the Elk Patrol was a strip of ribbon bearing
the words neatly printed by hand &ldquo;Many
Happy Returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two here stuck together,&rdquo; said
Connie Bennet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you think you&rsquo;re twice as
good a scout as anyone else,&rdquo; piped up Roy.
&ldquo;You should worry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The Elks were pinning these on amid much
merriment when Garry Everson and his two
companions came up the hill and took their
seats near Harry Arnold, toward the foot of
the table. Whatever show of coldness and
resentment this odd trio (and particularly its
leader) had borne lately, there was none visible
now, save in a certain restraint on both
sides and a lack of easy converse between
Garry and those near him. Jeffrey seemed
sober and half frightened, but little Raymond&rsquo;s
face was wreathed in smiles. Jeb Rushmore
waved pleasantly to them from the distant
end of the long board and they acknowledged
his salute.</p>
<p>Then the camp master drew himself together
and lifted his long, lanky form to his
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m much on speechifyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; baout all I&rsquo;m cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; ter do is jes&rsquo;
ter set ye on the trail &rsquo;n&rsquo; let ye folly it. Onct
thar come out west a gent from that thar
Smithson Institution in Wash&rsquo;n&rsquo;ton, &rsquo;n&rsquo; hearin&rsquo;t
I wuz used ter killin&rsquo; grizzlies he sez,
&lsquo;Pard, you&rsquo;re the man I want ter talk to &rsquo;baout
grizzlies.&rsquo; He wuz one o&rsquo; them zoologist
fellers. &lsquo;All I know &rsquo;baout grizzlies,&rsquo; sez I,
&lsquo;I can tell ye in two words&mdash;<i>Don&rsquo;t miss!</i> I
leave it t&rsquo;the other feller ter write &rsquo;baout &rsquo;em.&rsquo;
&lsquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the same here likewise&mdash;ez the feller
sez. I leave it to the others t&rsquo;do th&rsquo;talkin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;cause
if I try t&rsquo;do it myself I&rsquo;ll sure miss.
&rsquo;An&rsquo; I reckon as Mr. Ellsworth is the proper
one. I never stood behind nobuddy when
anythin&rsquo; wuz goin&rsquo; on&mdash;Gen&rsquo;l Custer cud tell
ye that&mdash;but I reckon I&rsquo;ll have ter make fer
shelter naow &rsquo;n&rsquo; leave him on the firin&rsquo; line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprawled into his seat amid a very
tempest of applause and cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Jeb!&rdquo; they called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Jeb Rushmore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Jeb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was forced to stand up three times in
acknowledgement. Then Mr. Ellsworth,
scoutmaster of the First Bridgeboro Troop,
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Mr. Rushmore
has, as usual, hit the mark&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you said something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He uses no rifle nowadays, but scouts by
the dozen fall for him. (Cheers) He may
run for shelter, but he will never find any
shelter from the love and the applause and
the homage which every visitor at Temple
Camp, young and old, has for him! (Great
shouting.) He is a whole scout handbook in
himself. I ask every scout at this board to
stand and give three cheers for Jeb Rushmore!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The boys were on their feet before the
words were out of his mouth, and the lusty
echo swept back from the hills across the lake
as if nature herself would pay her homage
to the man who knew and loved her so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while we are standing let us give
three cheers for the man who discovered Jeb
Rushmore and brought him from Arizona&mdash;by
the ears. (Laughter.) You all know
whom I mean&mdash;John Temple, the founder of
Temple Camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the shouting had subsided, Mr.
Ellsworth continued, &ldquo;Scouts, we are not joining
in this celebration to make a hero of any
of our number. There is but one hero at
Temple Camp. He sits at the head of the
table. (Applause.) And if it were not for
one fact I think I should have vetoed this
merrymaking and the Bridgeboro Troop
would have had its celebration by itself and
not have obtruded its family joys upon others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are here, scouts, to celebrate the second
anniversary of the Elk Patrol of which
Tom Slade is the leader&mdash;and organizer. It
is not because Tom is a scout, but because he
is a <i>scout-maker</i>, that we wish to honor him,
and his all but completed patrol. And that
is what I want every scout here to know and
to take back with you to the several parts of
the country from which you come. It is not
enough to be a scout&mdash;one must be a <i>scout-maker</i>.
He must reach out to the right and
to the left&mdash;into the highways and byways&mdash;and
muster his recruits. That is the only way
that our great army&mdash;or rather, our great
brotherhood&mdash;can grow. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get you,&rdquo; they answered, laughing at
his use of the slang which he was so ready
to learn from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Slade holds the gold cross for an act
of great bravery here last summer. He holds
seven merit badges and is about to win two
more. On the first night of his arrival here
this summer, he had the spunk and the courage
and persistence to choose a little party and
lead them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheer upon cheer drowned his words.
Tom himself sat, stolid as usual, but smiling
in embarrassment as scout after scout, clustering
about him, slapped him on the shoulder.
A few noticed that Garry smiled and applauded,
but kept to his seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Tom Slade!&rdquo; they called again
and again.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellsworth with difficulty continued,
&ldquo;And to lead them up into that wilderness
over yonder, because he could not sit down,
tired and travel worn as he was, while some
one lay dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, scouts&mdash;listen and I will
be through. These things are all to his credit&mdash;to
the credit of his patrol, of his troop, of
the whole scout family, here in this beloved
land of ours. But when I think of Tom
Slade&mdash;as I often do,&rdquo; he added, smiling, oh,
so pleasantly, at Tom; &ldquo;I think not only of
how he raised himself out of dirt and mischief
to this noble level where you see him,
but of how he went back into the byways and
found these boys who now form his splendid
patrol. <i>I</i> tried to get Connie Bennet and
failed. (Laughter.) <i>I</i> made a stab for the
celebrated Bronson twins&mdash;nothing doing.
They were too busy ringing other people&rsquo;s
doorbells. (Laughter.) I made a grandstand
play for others, but was turned down hard.
Why? Because it takes a boy to recruit a
boy. So all of you scouts pack that little
fact down in the corner of your duffel bags
and take it home with you. If every scout
secured a scout, where there are ten thousand
now there would be twenty thousand, and
where there are five hundred thousand, there
would be a million! I ask every scout here to
stand up and as he gives three cheers for Tom
Slade, scout-maker, to resolve that he will
make at least one scout before he comes here
another summer. And now three cheers for
the Elk Patrol on its second birthday, and
three cheers for Tom Slade, and three cheers
for the eighth scout&mdash;whoever and wherever
he may be&mdash;who before another summer shall
make the Elk Patrol complete as well as
honored!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Back across the still bosom of Black Lake,
again and again, the cheers reverberated,
drowning the closing words of Mr. Ellsworth&rsquo;s
speech. Pee-wee Harris, standing on
the seat, waved his scarf and shouted himself
hoarse. Roy, with the announcement megaphone,
called, &ldquo;Oh, you Tomasso!&rdquo; Raymond
Hollister clapped his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooch, spooch&mdash;speak a spooch!&rdquo; called
Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Tom, with his face scarlet, shook his head
as Mr. Ellsworth looked at him and the scoutmaster
held up a staying hand in sympathy
with his embarrassment. &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;d
rather eat,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the eats!&rdquo; shouted Roy,
irrepressibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eats&rdquo; after being uproariously cheered,
were forthwith assailed until there was
nothing left of them, and all agreed that the
meal beat the regulation Temple Camp Sunday
dinner twenty ways. And that was saying
a good deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, &ldquo;since this
celebration originated in the fertile brain of
the renowned leader of the Silver Foxes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, give them a chance to cheer me,&rdquo;
interrupted Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is my duty to put the balance
of our program into his able hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me while I blush,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, I believe, a few remembrances
and these it shall be his pleasure to bring forward.
I present to you,&rdquo; he added, smiling,
&ldquo;the most silvery fox of them all, Roy Blakeley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why pick on me?&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;I thought
I was going to be the buttered toast master,
but it seems I&rsquo;m to be the souvenir slinger.
I should worry. I go where duty calls, and
I wouldn&rsquo;t run after any job&mdash;especially if
it&rsquo;s a good runner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts and sprouts,&rdquo; he continued, with a
sly glance at Pee-wee; &ldquo;now you&rsquo;re supposed
to say, &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; they called, laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you. There are several things
for the Honorable Tomasso Slade, otherwise
known as Thomas the Silent, or Sherlock Nobody
Holmes of Bridgeboro, N. G. Tomasso
Slade is a home-made scout&mdash;I mean a <i>self</i>-made
scout&mdash;and he&rsquo;s made so as he can&rsquo;t
smile.&rdquo; (He was beginning to smile however.)
&ldquo;The first present is from his boyhood&rsquo;s
friend, Roy Blakeley (that&rsquo;s me) and
it is intended to make him laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed across the table a turkey feather
with a bow of ribbon tied about it. &ldquo;And
this,&rdquo; he added, lifting the huge elk&rsquo;s head to
the board and smiling at Tom&rsquo;s surprise, &ldquo;is
from Mr. Rushmore; its history, by Mr.
Rushmore himself, is writ, wrot, wrote&mdash;on
that piece of paper tied to the horns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Tom lifted the panel with the noble head
and magnificent antlers and as the boys crowded
about him he could only look toward Jeb
with his eyes swimming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Tommy,&rdquo; smiled Jeb, as
pleased as Tom himself.</p>
<p>The cat&rsquo;s collar belt was handed over
amid much laughter, and various other small
tokens, some humorous and all of a kind easily
made or procurable in the woodland community.
The wireless set almost knocked
Tom off his feet, and when it was followed by
the bugle with the Elk patrol names engraved
upon it, he was overwhelmed.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thomas Slade</p>
<p class="t0">William Bronson</p>
<p class="t0">Theodore Bronson</p>
<p class="t0">Connover Bennet</p>
<p class="t0">George O&rsquo;Connor</p>
<p class="t0">Charles O&rsquo;Connor</p>
<p class="t0">Wade Van Ester</p>
</div>
<p>He blinked as he gazed at the highly polished
metal, at the names which had meant
labor and long effort for him, and which bespoke
his success. His hand almost shook as
he fumbled the silken tassel of the beautiful
instrument, and the familiar names upon it
seemed like fifty names wrought into an intricate
design.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
smiling and placing a reassuring hand
on his shoulder. &ldquo;They understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was Roy who came to his rescue, as
he had done more than once before, and saved
him further embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow it, Tomasso,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Maybe
you can blow up your other recruit if you
blow loud enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, maybe it&rsquo;ll be like the shot heard
round the world,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or like the music of old Ichabod Crane,
which they say is still heard in Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;Perhaps it will
be heard months hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow for him, anyway,&rdquo; said Roy.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come some day, you can bet, and we&rsquo;ll
all wish it at the same time, while you&rsquo;re
blowing, Tom. Go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom raised the bugle to his lips laughing,
and as he blew lustily the echo of its attenuated
final note was borne back with the freshening
night breeze, like a faint answer from
the encompassing hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here,&rdquo; said an impassive voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>They all stood staring, the scouts still at
their places and those clustered about Tom,
and saw Garry Everson standing in his place
in the characteristic attitude which was familiar
to them all, one hand on his hip, the other
in his pocket.</p>
<p>As they stared at him, Jeffrey Waring,
gulping nervously, rose from his seat and
stood beside him for a second. Then, at Garry&rsquo;s
nod, he moved around to Tom&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him your name,&rdquo; said Garry, smiling,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll want it for the bugle, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Harry Stanton,&rdquo; he said,
hesitatingly, but seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you fellows,&rdquo; said Garry quietly,
&ldquo;had better take him home to his mother and
father before you make any other plans. I&rsquo;m
not going to do <i>your</i> work for you. I&rsquo;ve done
my part. It&rsquo;s for you to take him back. May
I look at that bugle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom did not hand him the bugle. He
stood rooted to where he stood, staring like
an idiot.</p>
<p>Some one stooped and picked up the bugle
which had fallen to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">GARRY&rsquo;S STORY AND HARRY STANTON&rsquo;S</span></h2>
<p>It was around the glowing camp fire on
that memorable night that the wondering boys
heard Garry Everson&rsquo;s simple, unboastful tale
of the new kind of first-aid which had helped
him to solve the mystery of Jeffrey Waring
and put Tom Slade in the way of realizing
his fondest dream&mdash;that of returning Harry
Stanton to his young sister and his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we looked like beans, I&rsquo;d say you were
trying to string us,&rdquo; observed Roy, as he sat
in his familiar posture near the fire, his knees
drawn up and his hands clasped about them.
&ldquo;It beats anything <i>I</i> ever heard. Our beloved
scoutmaster will have to go away, way
back and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ellsworth, still half incredulous,
shook his head. &ldquo;The pity of it is,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no merit badge for this kind of
first-aid. There can be no doubt of the truth
of this thing, I suppose?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Garry laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;I wish
I could be as sure of his having the boat for
his own&mdash;now that he&rsquo;s somebody else. It&rsquo;s
one peacherino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you suspected that first night, you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no&mdash;not exactly. You fellows have
got to remember that my father was an alienist,
if you know what that is, and I&rsquo;ve heard
him tell about just such troubles as Harry&rsquo;s.
So I don&rsquo;t deserve much credit. Only I had
to be very careful. You can see yourselves
it wasn&rsquo;t a case for bandages and splints and
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be pretty hard to give you too
much credit,&rdquo; Doc Carson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I noticed,&rdquo; Garry went
on, &ldquo;was the way Tom stared when he first
saw him that night up in the woods. He was
sure he&rsquo;d seen him before. I didn&rsquo;t think much
about that though till afterwards when other
little things set me thinking and then I remembered
about it and I began to put two and
two together. When Jeffrey told me where
he belonged I remembered about the old gentleman
in Vale Centre who came home one
time with a young fellow he called his nephew
and how all the people in the village wondered
who the nephew was. They didn&rsquo;t live
near enough for me to know much about them
and I don&rsquo;t know as I ever saw Jeffrey until
that night up on the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was while we were bringing Mr.
Waring down through the woods on the
stretcher that Tom said something about the
Stantons&mdash;he just mentioned the name sort
of off-hand, and I noticed that Jeffrey stared
at him and looked sort of worried or puzzled,
kind of, and then started in again chattering
in that way of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it came jumping into my head all
of a sudden that he was trying to think of
something and couldn&rsquo;t. And I was wondering
if Tom really ever had seen him before,
when I just happened to think&mdash;the idea came
to me, sort of&mdash;that maybe it was his sister
that Tom had seen. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t think
so but the idea wouldn&rsquo;t go away and I decided
that anyway I&rsquo;d keep Jeffrey near me
if I could and not let him get mixed up with
the crowd where he&rsquo;d be all the time getting
excited, and see if I couldn&rsquo;t find out something
about him. And even as it was, that
was some tall job, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly kept by yourselves,&rdquo; some
one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the time was short and I wanted
to see if maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t get better by just
being quiet. I knew a person could get to
be&mdash;sort of&mdash;flighty, like, from an accident
or something like that, and lose his memory,
and be like a kid, and that sometimes, if he
lives quiet and don&rsquo;t get excited or see many
people, he&rsquo;ll begin to remember things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, we&rsquo;ve got to hand it to you,&rdquo; said
Roy, earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spent your whole
vacation buried alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even still I didn&rsquo;t exactly think he was
Harry Stanton,&rdquo; Garry went on, &ldquo;but after,
a while, just for experiment, kind of, I began
springing words on him that I thought he
might remember. I sprung <i>Stanton</i> and
<i>Nyack</i> but there wasn&rsquo;t any come-back until
one day&mdash;it was the day Arnold dropped in
to see me&mdash;I sprung the word <i>Nymph</i> as a
good name for a boat and that seemed to kind
of hit him. He just stared and stared and
stared. After that I decided to take him
down to Catskill Landing to look at that
sumptuous yacht of his and then to show him
the <i>Good Turn</i>. I knew that sometimes when
a person sees the thing that caused his trouble
or goes back to the same place, maybe, or
something of that sort, his memory comes
back to him all of a sudden and he wakes up
as if he&rsquo;d been dreaming, as you might say.
There&rsquo;s a long name they have for it, but I
can&rsquo;t seem to remember it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a
blamed funny thing, but it&rsquo;s true. If you
want to know what happened when we trespassed
on the <i>Good Turn</i>, you&rsquo;d better let
<i>him</i> tell you, hey, Jeff?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The boy who had been the subject of Garry&rsquo;s
simple narrative was smiling, as every
one turned toward him, and though the familiar
trace of childishness was not entirely
gone from his smile, there was a suggestion
of mental poise or self-possession, even in the
face of this public stare, which had not been
there before. And though one or two noticed
(for they were scouts and noticed things) that
he twirled one finger nervously with his other
hand, he at least did not begin to chatter with
that distressing agitation and irrational boastfulness
which the camp had known so well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>He had not changed his habit and demeanor
as a lightning change performer will doff
his costume, but there was a difference and
everyone could see it. The woods and the
quiet water and the sympathetic surroundings
were to do much for him yet and it would be
a long journey back to mental keenness and
physical vigor. But he was different, and it
seemed all very wonderful. It was a knockout
blow to Doc Carson, proficient though he
was in his chosen specialty, for not a word
about this kind of business had he ever seen
in his study of First-Aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Stanton, you old Jekyll and Hyde,&rdquo;
Garry repeated, cheerily; &ldquo;you came near
getting me in Dutch with this bunch. Tell
them about the <i>Nymph</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Stanton smiled naturally and now
Tom Slade, who was watching his every
movement, realized how much like his
young sister he looked. His nose wrinkled
a little, just like hers, when he smiled. There
was no doubt as to who he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was my boat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
thought it was the next morning. It seemed
as if I was just waking up. I don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s
my boat, now, of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is yours, all right,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my other one and I don&rsquo;t want
it. But it seemed as if I had fallen asleep on
it and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thought I was Benty Willis for a
minute,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;then, sort of, I knew all about
what happened. When I saw my&mdash;the&mdash;boat,
I knew. I knew for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a few seconds of silence, broken
by Mr. Ellsworth&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,
almost unbelievable.&rdquo; And still no one else
spoke, the company only gazing at Harry
Stanton, as one might look at an apparition.</p>
<p>Then Doc Carson, Raven and First-Aid
Scout, said, &ldquo;Garry, you&rsquo;re a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the thanks he got&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Connie Bennet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; laughed Garry;
&ldquo;I had my little trail to follow, and I followed
it, that&rsquo;s all. I just kept my eyes on the
trail and not on you fellows&mdash;just as Jeb is all
the time telling us. If he had seen that boat
too soon, or been jollied or got too much excited
or tired he might have gone nutty, for
sure. Tell us a camp-fire yarn, Roy, I want
Harry to see that we&rsquo;ve got a real &lsquo;nut&rsquo; in the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>But Roy told no yarn, and still they were
all silent. After a while, Tom spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make you talk about it,
if you don&rsquo;t feel like it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or if you
don&rsquo;t remember, but I always thought that
maybe you were alive because a board belonging
to your launch&rsquo;s skiff was in the launch
when we got her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry laughed. &ldquo;Tell him how it happened,
Stanton,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember all about it,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I
was in the launch and Benty was in the tender,
bailing it out. There was a long rope
from the tender to the <i>Nymph</i>. He was
singing and I was sitting in the cabin talking
to him. We had a light on the launch. That&rsquo;s
the same way as I told it to you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
he questioned, turning to Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I heard a speed-boat coming&mdash;down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said,&rdquo; Garry encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was up. Anyway I called, but
I suppose they couldn&rsquo;t hear me on account
of their exhaust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;He wanted to
warn them about the small boat which was
about thirty feet away and had no light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They crashed into it and Benty yelled
that he was hurt and said he had hold of the
rope. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo; Stanton
broke off, looking frightened and perplexed,
and rubbed his hands together distressingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me finish it for you and see if I
don&rsquo;t get it right,&rdquo; said Garry, soothingly.
&ldquo;Jeff pulled the rope so as to save Benty, who
couldn&rsquo;t swim very well. But Benty must
have let go. That right, Jeff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait a minute.&rdquo; Garry looked
across the fire at Tom. &ldquo;And all there was at
the end of the rope was a board from the skiff.
The skiff must have been all smashed to
pieces. It was the board that had the ring in
it that the boat was tied to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Stanton
pulled it aboard thinking his friend was
clinging to it. And when he saw how it was
he dived for him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dived right away,&rdquo; interrupted Harry
Stanton, shuddering, &ldquo;and I swam all around
and I called&mdash;I swam way out and then there
was a big light that dazzled me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; concluded Garry. &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t tell you any more because he doesn&rsquo;t remember
any more till he was in Mr. Waring&rsquo;s
house. We&rsquo;re going to try to find out about
it, aren&rsquo;t we. Stan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved closer to the boy and put his
arm about his shoulder with a significant look
at the others as if to ask them not to question
him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wants us all to go down to Nyack
with him in his own boat which has the other
one beat forty-&rsquo;leven ways. He says he
wouldn&rsquo;t ride in that old tub now, hey, Stan?
And you can keep it or sink it just as you
please. And when we get to Nyack he wants
a committee of three scouts to go home with
him while the rest of us stay on the boat. And
after that, if we can fix it up, we&rsquo;re all going
to take a cruise up the river and through the
lakes for a little call on Uncle Sam at Plattsburg.
Hey, Stan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the three scouts that he wants to go
up home with him (he&rsquo;s very particular about
it) are Tom Slade and Roy and Pee-wee Harris,
because they&rsquo;re the ones who were there
last year and they know his sister, so it&rsquo;s up
to them to take him back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; Roy promptly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m out of it,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, such a shout as might have
raised the dead resounded. It was Pee-wee
Harris, flying off the handle, as he realized
the meaning of Garry&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, crinkums, won&rsquo;t it be great!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;ll think up a little
kind of a speech to make to her&mdash;gee, it&rsquo;s just
like a story, with&mdash;with&mdash;yachts and long lost
brothers and things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially things,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">PEE-WEE TRIUMPHANT</span></h2>
<p>It was toward the close of a beautiful summer
afternoon that a trim Racine cruiser poked
her nose around the boat club&rsquo;s anchorage
near Nyack on the Hudson, and brought up
alongside one of the commercial wharves,
which made an inharmonious background to
the spotless white hull and shining mahogany
cabin. She made no more noise than a canoe.
The first rays of the declining sun fell upon
her knife-like brass bow and reflected from
her shining metal parts. As she touched the
dock several scouts scrambled from her and
made her fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimin-<i>ety</i>! But she gets over the water!&rdquo;
remarked Connie Bennet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been
a couple of days or more coming down in
the <i>Good Turn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t she take the hills fine!&rdquo; said
Roy Blakeley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a <i>regular</i> boat,&rdquo; observed Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Good Turn</i> is all right only her
bow&rsquo;s too near the stern,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, everything looks the same, doesn&rsquo;t
it,&rdquo; said Pee-wee, gazing about him. &ldquo;This
is just where we stood when it began to rain
last year. Then we went up that road and
that&rsquo;s where we found the <i>Good Turn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun was going down just as it is now,&rdquo;
said Tom, climbing out over the combing.
&ldquo;I remember those hills over there looked
just like they do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, even the water&rsquo;s wet, just the same
as it was then. Don&rsquo;t you remember how I
spoke about the water being so wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just like a book,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.
&ldquo;Gee, I never thought it would happen this
way; I saw a movie play once where a feller&mdash;a
long lost brother&mdash;came home, and oh,
cracky, they fell all over him. They thought
he was dead and his mother she was looking
at his picture and crying&mdash;I mean weeping&mdash;when
all of a sudden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden Pee-wee Harris will be
left behind if he doesn&rsquo;t get a hustle,&rdquo; said
Roy. &ldquo;Come on, wash up and get your hair
fixed if you expect to make that speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how I&rsquo;m going to begin?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you&rsquo;re going to end, if you
don&rsquo;t get a hustle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole Bridgeboro troop with Garry
and Raymond and Harry Stanton, had come
down from Catskill Landing. Their stay at
Temple Camp was ended and they had said
good-bye to Harry Arnold and his young
friend, whom they hoped to meet again next
summer. Little they dreamed of the strange
circumstances under which that meeting was
to occur. They had left the <i>Good Turn</i> up
the river for they hoped to cruise northward
again in the larger boat.</p>
<p>In the cool of the evening the three scouts
who had trod this same road a year before,
accompanied by the boy who had trod it many
times himself in days gone by, made their
way through the beautiful hilly country for
West Nyack. And, indeed, their errand
seemed, as Pee-wee had suggested, like a
chapter out of a book.</p>
<p>Garry had positively refused to go with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you fellows that she gave the boat
to and it&rsquo;s for you to pay her back,&rdquo; he had
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how old&mdash;how Mr.
Stanton laughed when I talked to him?&rdquo; said
Pee-wee as they tramped along the familiar
road. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny that I put it into his
head to give us the boat. And I bet if I ask
him to let Harry go on a cruise now, he&rsquo;ll
do it. You leave it to me&mdash;I know how to
handle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, kiddo, we&rsquo;ll leave it to you,&rdquo;
laughed Roy, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got a sneaking idea
that when they once get their fists on our long
lost son and brother it&rsquo;ll take a crow-bar to
pry him loose again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be hard to say what Harry Stanton&rsquo;s
feelings were as he walked homeward
with his three companions. He seemed nervous
and anxious and said but little, but every
object which met his gaze now was familiar
to him and as he looked about upon the very
fields where he had played and the houses
which he knew he seemed to acquire poise and
self-possession. An odd habit which he had
shown to Garry and somewhat to the others
of confusing his life at Mr. Waring&rsquo;s with his
old life at home, was fast disappearing and
now each familiar sight seemed to act like
a potent medicine to bring him to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>A man who passed them on the road turned
and stared at him, then went on, turning
again and again. He spoke to a man who
was raking a lawn and who also stared after
him. The boys paid no heed.</p>
<p>At last they reached the house. No one
was about, and they took a short cut across
the lawn, right under the big tree where Pee-wee
had captured the fugitive bird. Here
was a garden bench and leaving Harry Stanton
seated upon it, they went up on the porch and
rang the bell. Pee-wee was visibly nervous
and even Roy showed repressed excitement,
but Tom was stolid as he always was.</p>
<p>There was the calling of a voice within,
the faint sound of footsteps on the stair, and
young Ruth Stanton stood on the inner side
of the screen door looking at them. For a moment
she stared in amazement and in that
momentary look Tom caught a glint of the
same expression that had puzzled him in Jeffrey
Waring in their first encounter on the
lonely hill. Then suddenly her face lighted
up with a merry smile of recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello,&rdquo; she said, opening the door and
speaking in great surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You remember us?&rdquo; laughed Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I did, but you&rsquo;re the last
persons I ever expected to see. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely,
your coming again&mdash;just as if you had
dropped from the clouds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been some shower, wouldn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; laughed Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;ve got to stay to supper. We&rsquo;re going to
have popovers&mdash;do you like popovers? I
adore them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what they are,&rdquo; said Roy,
&ldquo;but we like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down in the wicker chairs which
formed a little circle on the deep, shaded
porch, the girl swinging her feet back and
forth and gazing from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been up to camp,&rdquo; Tom began.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t that lovely&mdash;I wish I was a boy!
How&rsquo;s the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it <i>is</i> great being a boy,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.
&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boat is in the best of health, thank
you,&rdquo; interrupted Roy, fearing that Pee-wee
would say too much; &ldquo;and one of the reasons
we hiked up here is because we want to pay
you back for it. As Pee-wee says, a scout has
to be cautious and he didn&rsquo;t want us to pay
you back till we were sure the boat was all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that!&rdquo; cried Pee-wee, indignantly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe him, I never said
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ve been a long time getting around
to it,&rdquo; continued Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I
thought you just came to <i>see</i> me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to tell you our adventures
since we saw you,&rdquo; added Pee-wee.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had some dandy ones. One in particular
that you&rsquo;ll like to hear about,&rdquo; he
added, with an air of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When anybody does anything for a scout,&rdquo;
Tom began again in his sober way, &ldquo;he has
to remember it and do them a good turn. We
couldn&rsquo;t do you one because we couldn&rsquo;t think
of anything big enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ll tell you how it is,&rdquo; interrupted
Pee-wee, &ldquo;each good turn&rsquo;s got to be
better than the other one&mdash;they get bigger&mdash;kind
of, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d
have to do you a bigger one to pay back and
you&rsquo;d have to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think we&rsquo;ve hit on a pretty good one,&rdquo;
said Roy. &ldquo;Anyway, how&rsquo;s the bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s fine! He can say &lsquo;Good-night&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Welcome, home&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing to say just now,&rdquo; Roy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m teaching him to say &lsquo;Down with
the Kaiser&rsquo;! Isn&rsquo;t that perfectly terrible!
Anyway, I&rsquo;m not neutral. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; Roy confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you go to war if we had a war?&rdquo;
she asked impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we&rsquo;d give old Uncle Samuel a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that glorious! But suppose you
should get killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not supposing things now,&rdquo; said
Roy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something to tell you. We
came back to bring you a present. When
people come across with boats and things
like that we don&rsquo;t let them get away with it&mdash;hey,
Tom? So we&rsquo;re here with our little
come-back. What d&rsquo;ye say we stroll down on
the lawn? We left our package on that bench
out there; and just for the fun of it we&rsquo;d like
to poke around where Pee-wee pulled his
stunt last summer. Then well go in and hear
the parrot say &lsquo;Welcome home&rsquo;&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye
say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you&rsquo;ve got to stay to supper, so
that you can see papa,&rdquo; Ruth said. &ldquo;He
laughs whenever he thinks of how you called
him Old Man Stanton. But he isn&rsquo;t grouchy&mdash;only
he&rsquo;ll never be the same since my
brother&mdash;died. And besides, you have to tell
me your adventures, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down the steps and crossed the
lawn. The girl, running ahead, seemed not
to notice the lone figure on the bench with its
back toward her till she was within a few feet
of it. Then she paused in surprise and as she
did so, Harry Stanton rose and turned to face
her, the while grasping the back of the bench
nervously....</p>
<p>The several accounts of the three scouts as
to what happened then, differed materially.
There was no doubt that Ruth stepped quickly
back in momentary fright, grasping the
arm of Pee-wee who happened to be nearest
her. Pee-wee said that her hand was trembling
and that she &ldquo;clutched him in terror.&rdquo;
Roy maintained that the &ldquo;clutching in terror
business&rdquo; came out of a heroic scene from one
of Alger&rsquo;s books. Tom said that for a moment
she seemed about to run, which Pee-wee
admitted, claiming that she thought better of
it when she found that he was near. All
agreed that she was first panic-stricken and
then greatly agitated as Roy took her hand
and drew her to the bench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>At all events, it was only for a moment or
two and then she and her brother were in each
other&rsquo;s arms. There is no authentic account
of what happened then, for the three visitors,
being good scouts, strolled to the hedge which
bordered the lawn and looked at the scenery
beyond. It must have been beautiful scenery
and very affecting, for Pee-wee&rsquo;s eyes were
brimming, and Tom&rsquo;s and Roy&rsquo;s were not
exactly what you would call dry....</p>

<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">AT THE STANTONS&rsquo;</span></h2>
<p>The return of Harry Stanton to his home
was a nine days&rsquo; wonder in the village. Poor
Mrs. Stanton seemed almost unable to comprehend
the wonderful reality of his actual
presence and she kept him by her constantly,
even to the point of accompanying him back
and forth from the river. The boys noted
these affectionate attentions with dismay, for
they wished to make a cruise in the beautiful
boat, with its proud owner as their companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; said Pee-wee. &ldquo;I
know how to handle mothers; we&rsquo;ve got to
wait for the something or otherological moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>The days which followed were days of stress
but of happiness to all concerned. Mr. Stanton
lost no time in going to Poughkeepsie
where he got all the information that could
be obtained from Mr. Waring&rsquo;s executor and
friends as to how the eccentric but kindly old
gentleman came into possession of the so-called
nephew on whom he had showered
wealth and sympathetic attention.</p>
<p>Because he <i>had</i> been eccentric, his intimates
knew but little of his affairs, but the facts,
as Mr. Stanton was able to piece them together,
were that Mr. Waring had lost his
wife and only son and that he had never been
the same afterward. He lived the life of a
recluse in his lonely, luxurious home. Two
years before he had started up the Hudson in
his beautiful boat, accompanied by a valet
and a man to run the craft, intending to visit
some remote spot where he had enjoyed the
trout fishing in his early years.</p>
<p>All that his business friends knew in addition
to this was that he had returned almost
immediately, bringing with him an apparently
weak-minded boy whom he called his
nephew and whose self-appointed guardian
and benefactor he became.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton tried to find the two men who
had accompanied their employer on that
mysterious cruise. The valet had died, but
he located the other man working in a munitions
plant not far from Poughkeepsie. From
this man, who spoke only broken English, he
learned something of his son&rsquo;s rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>While cruising upstream at night, he said,
they had heard a cry from the water and
throwing the searchlight about had located a
drowning person, whom they pulled aboard.
It was a boy, the man said, whose head had
been frightfully injured, the skull being
cracked, as was discernible through his
plastered, soaking hair. He was bruised in
several other places and lost consciousness as
soon as they got him aboard the launch.</p>
<p>They had turned the boat at once and returned
home, where the victim, still unconscious,
was attended by &ldquo;great doctors.&rdquo; The
man had not lived at Mr. Waring&rsquo;s house and
he knew very little more except what he had
heard indirectly. The boy jabbered, he said,
and did not know who he was and talked nonsense.
Then he had heard that an operation
was performed, that the edges of the broken
skull were lifted up into place, and that the
boy was better but &ldquo;nutty.&rdquo; He had later
heard a rumor that the boy was dead. That
was all he knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Mr. Stanton had had no difficulty in locating
James, the chauffeur, whom Jeffrey
Waring had mentioned in connection with
his pigeons, and from him he had received
a more coherent account of Mr. Waring&rsquo;s second
cruise, which was destined to have a fatal
sequel for himself and momentous consequences
for his ward.</p>
<p>James had, he said, entered Mr. Waring&rsquo;s
employ the year before and found the old
gentleman&rsquo;s nephew to be a &ldquo;queer lad&rdquo; who,
he understood, had once had a dreadful accident
of some sort. He got excited easily, the
man said, and at such times said the most
extravagant things. He had pigeons and
dogs and lived an odd sort of life by himself.</p>
<p>In the early part of the summer Mr. Waring
had again planned a trip to his favorite
fishing retreat, believing that the quiet and
remoteness of the place would help the boy,
who was already greatly improved. The doctors,
so the man said, had recommended the
camping trip.</p>
<p>They had made an uneventful but pleasant
trip up the river in the <i>Rambler</i> and after
they had moored her near Catskill Landing
Mr. Waring had sent James back to Vale
Centre to attend to his regular duties there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>That was all that Mr. Stanton could learn
and he returned home somewhat puzzled as
to whether Mr. Waring had ever tried to locate
Harry&rsquo;s people, or whether he intended
to do so when the boy should have regained
his health and mental poise. He had lavished
wealth and kindness on the stricken lad, that
was certain; the last days of his life had been
spent in a sojourn to a remote spot dear to his
own memory in the hope that it might hasten
the boy&rsquo;s recovery; and the Stantons could
not think otherwise of him than as one, peculiar
indeed, but of the purest motive and overflowing
with kindness. Nor did they ever
learn exactly what had happened to Harry
while in the water, though they held to the
belief that he had been injured by the paddlewheel
of some steamer.</p>
<p>That Garry Everson, scout, had completed
the work which the old gentleman had begun
was now realized by all and with it the boys
realized the quiet patience with which he had
borne their coldness and even their taunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real hero,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All others are imitations,&rdquo; agreed Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>During Mr. Stanton&rsquo;s absence, Mr. Ellsworth
had made a flying trip to Bridgeboro
to arrange for the troop&rsquo;s absence for another
week or two, and meanwhile the scouts camped
on the boat, spending much of their time
at the Stanton place, where they played tennis
and basket-ball and taught the parrot to
say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a scout,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poor Pee-wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were days of great delight to Ruth
Stanton. In contemptuous defiance of Pee-wee&rsquo;s
proud assertion that &ldquo;boys could do
things that girls couldn&rsquo;t do&rdquo; she beat him
again and again at tennis, and beat the rest of
them, too, for she was an old hand at the
game.</p>
<p>For the first time, too, her brother showed
his interest and skill in outdoor games; his
fondness for tennis seemed to come back on
him in a rush, and though he sometimes got
rattled and did not think quickly enough, his
playing was rapid and accurate in the main
and he and Ruth came out first in the tournament
in which they all joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wait till you see Harry swim!&rdquo; she
said proudly, as, racket in hand, she sank
onto a garden bench; &ldquo;he can swim across
the river and back; do you know how far that
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how far it is over; I don&rsquo;t know
how far it is back,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a correct imitation of a boy
scout raising a racket,&rdquo; Roy said, holding
his racket high in the air. &ldquo;Next imitation,
that of a boy scout following a trail,&rdquo; he
added, going on his hands and knees and with
an absurd air of scrutiny and stealth following
the chalk mark around the tennis court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he too silly!&rdquo; laughed Ruth.</p>
<p>Roy resumed his seat beside her. &ldquo;Did
you hear about the Germans bombarding a
man&rsquo;s garden and shelling all his peas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&mdash;&rdquo; began Ruth. &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,
it&rsquo;s a joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is a boy scout?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any. Here&rsquo;s another. What&rsquo;s
the aim of a scout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A correct aim. Did you hear about the
scout that went camping without any duffel
bag or baggage, yet he carried fifteen good-sized
articles in his back pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t! How could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a copy of <i>Boys&rsquo; Life</i> with fifteen
articles in it. Which has the most stories,
<i>Boy&rsquo;s Life</i> or the Mutual Life? Here&rsquo;s another.
If <i>Every Boys&rsquo; Library</i> caught fire,
how would the smoke come out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In volumes, of course. Say, if it&rsquo;s
cowardly to strike a person who is on the
ground, is it all right to hit the trail? Here&rsquo;s
another&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know so much about them,&rdquo;
Ruth interrupted. &ldquo;Tell me what an Honor
Scout is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a riddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t a riddle; I really want to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Honor Scout is a scout that has a sense
of honor. There&rsquo;s only one scout in our
troop that has any sense of honor&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Honorable Tomasso Slade alias Sherlock Nobody
Holmes. He has the gold cross. Honorable
Garry Everson has the silver cross. That
means he has some sense of honor, but not so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word you&rsquo;re telling me,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Roy looked at her through the strings of
his racket. &ldquo;Boy Scout behind prison bars,&rdquo;
said he, teasingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> tell me,&rdquo; she said, turning to Doc
Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell you,&rdquo; said Pee-wee; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
to look out for him, he&rsquo;s a jollier. An Honor
Scout is one that has saved somebody&rsquo;s life&mdash;and
gets an honor medal&mdash;see? If he takes
a big chance and&mdash;and&mdash;kind of plunges into
the jaws of death&mdash;kind of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he gets the gold cross. If he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lands just outside the jaws,&rdquo; interrupted
Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; said Pee-wee. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t
take quite such a big chance but a <i>pretty</i> big
one, then he gets the silver cross. And if he
takes a small chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the size of Pee-wee,&rdquo; Roy put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he gets the bronze cross,&rdquo; Pee-wee
finished. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were lolling on and about the bench
near the tennis court, laughing at each other&rsquo;s
nonsense, when Harry Stanton jumped up
suddenly. Garry and Ruth watched him
keenly, as they always did when he became
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got an idea, a fine idea!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I got it from what Pee-wee said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, take your time, Stan,&rdquo; said
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to think of a name&mdash;a new name&mdash;for
the <i>Rambler</i> but I couldn&rsquo;t think of any.
I told my mother I&rsquo;d name it for Tom Slade
only that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to Garry, and it
would be the same if I named it for Garry&mdash;see?
Anyway&mdash;anyway&mdash;she said a boy&rsquo;s
name wouldn&rsquo;t be good, anyway. But if I
name it <i>Honor Scout</i>, it will be naming it for
both of them&mdash;won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, crinkums, you hit it!&rdquo; shouted Pee-wee,
enthusiastically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an insulation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspiration, you mean,&rdquo; corrected Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; demanded Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;only insulation is the covering
around a wire and inspiration is a good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise they&rsquo;re the same,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s one peach of a name!&rdquo; repeated
Pee-wee, undaunted, and pounding the back
of the bench. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piperino!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Stanton was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a bully name,&rdquo; said Westy Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and <i>I</i> thought of it&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; said
Harry, with the touch of childishness that still
showed itself at times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sure did,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of two names in one,&rdquo; said Will
Bronson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought of it just this minute,&rdquo; repeated
Harry, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Stan,&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Sit
down and watch the game now&mdash;watch your
sister trim Roy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t play with him, he&rsquo;s too silly,&rdquo;
said Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid of being beaten,&rdquo; challenged
Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By <i>you</i>? You don&rsquo;t even know how to
volley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to jolly,&rdquo; Roy came back.</p>
<p>They played much to Harry&rsquo;s amusement,
which was just what Garry wanted,
and Roy was ignominiously vanquished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re supposed to say &lsquo;Deuce&rsquo;!&rdquo;
Ruth called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use such language,&rdquo; answered Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bat it over there, silly, and then say &lsquo;My
advantage!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of a girl,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>It was no wonder he was beaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Roy and one or two of the others stayed
for supper and Ruth took him into the kitchen
(to the consternation of her mother and the
colored cook) and taught him to make popovers.
Being the troop&rsquo;s chef, he was greatly
interested and wore a huge kitchen apron on
which he was continually tripping.</p>
<p>Upon Mr. Stanton&rsquo;s return a slight cloud
was cast upon the rosy plans for a cruise,
partly from his hesitancy to let Harry go
with them and partly because of his doubts
as to whether his son ought to keep the boat
at all. Of these latter misgivings he was
cured by an elaborate argument of Pee-wee&rsquo;s.
Or, in any event, he surrendered&mdash;and Pee-wee
took the credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a peach of an argument I&rsquo;m going
to give him,&rdquo; said Pee-wee, as he and Roy
and Garry were hiking it to Shady Lawn for
a set of tennis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the lawyers call a
teckinality. Don&rsquo;t you remember he used one
last year when he gave us the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found Mr. Stanton on the porch, and
perched himself upon the railing near him,
swinging his legs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Stanton, when
Pee-wee broached the subject, &ldquo;whether I
shall let Harry keep the boat or not. Mr.
Waring was rather a queer man, and I don&rsquo;t
know whether we ought to take his will too
seriously. I shouldn&rsquo;t wish you boys to be
disappointed,&rdquo; he added, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how it is,&rdquo; said Pee-wee.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lawyer, kind of, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; Mr. Stanton conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it all out last night. Now you
gave us a boat, didn&rsquo;t you? And I&rsquo;m not
saying that wasn&rsquo;t a dandy thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have found pleasure in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the trouble was the fellow that
owned the boat was alive all the time and so
you really didn&rsquo;t have any right to give it to
us. That&rsquo;s a teckinality, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if Harry didn&rsquo;t have a boat of his own,
why, then, of course, we&rsquo;d have to give the
<i>Good Turn</i> back to him&mdash;&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s his, see?
But, of course, as long as he <i>has</i> a boat of his
own, it&rsquo;s all right. Anyway, you couldn&rsquo;t
stop us from leaving the <i>Good Turn</i> at Nyack
Landing if we wanted to. Even if you were
a&mdash;a&mdash;judge, you couldn&rsquo;t do that, could
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to be at your mercy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Stanton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another dandy argument, too&mdash;a
peach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s one of your own, I should like to
hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you want Harry to get well, don&rsquo;t
you? Maybe you don&rsquo;t know all that Garry
Everson did to make him&mdash;to help him get
better. And then he gave him up so&rsquo;s Tom
could have a full patrol. Gee, even <i>we</i> didn&rsquo;t
know what kind of a fellow Garry was&mdash;we
didn&rsquo;t. But we know now, you can bet. Maybe
Harry would get worse again if you took
that boat away from him. He&rsquo;s just thought
of a dandy name for it&mdash;the <i>Honor Scout</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; mused Mr. Stanton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that one pippin of a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we may let him have the boat,&rdquo;
said Mr. Stanton, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The whole
circumstance is so very strange&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can he make the cruise with us to
Plattsburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will see what Mr. Ellsworth thinks&mdash;and
the doctor. I don&rsquo;t quite see,&rdquo; Mr. Stanton
added, after a thoughtful pause, &ldquo;how
Harry can become a member of Tom Slade&rsquo;s
patrol, much as I should like to see him the
companion of you boys. We live so far from
Bridgeboro&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that way to you because you&rsquo;re
not a scout,&rdquo; interrupted Pee-wee, patronizingly.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve thought it all out and
we&rsquo;ve decided that twenty-three miles isn&rsquo;t so
far. You see, when you&rsquo;re a scout distance
doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything, because we hike.
And if you go scout-pace, you don&rsquo;t get tired
at all. Did you ever try scout-pace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve missed something. You
ought to try it. Would you like me to show
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stick to the automobile,&rdquo; said
Mr. Stanton, dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, when Harry gets all well
he could paddle down and he could run the
machine, and besides they have two autos at
Roy&rsquo;s and he runs them, and they&rsquo;ve got one
at Westy&rsquo;s&mdash;of course, it isn&rsquo;t exactly an automobile,
it&rsquo;s a Ford&mdash;and in the summer it
would be easy going back and forth and in
the winter we only have one meeting a week,
and he could come down Fridays and stay at
my house till Sunday. Oh, gee, I hope nothing
will happen now to stop him from joining
Tom&rsquo;s patrol. Tom would be awful
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Nothing did happen, and Pee-wee took his
full measure of glory. The doctor proved
his staunch supporter, and even Mrs. Stanton
said reluctantly that she supposed Harry
might go, but that they must be very careful
to bring him safely home to her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we bring him home once?&rdquo; Pee-wee
demanded. &ldquo;You leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">FIRST BRIDGEBORO B.S.A BECOMES A FULL TROOP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the initiation on the boat,
hey?&rdquo; exclaimed Pee-wee. &ldquo;Just like in
<i>Pinafore</i>, kind of. Ever see that play? It&rsquo;s
a dandy! I saw it&mdash;the whole of it is supposed
to be on a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I come and see the initiation?&rdquo; Ruth
Stanton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; began Roy, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; said Pee-wee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the installation of Harry Stanton as a
scout and a member of the Elk Patrol took
place on the deck of his own beautiful cruising
launch as it lay at Nyack Landing. The
troop&rsquo;s own ceremony, by which Tom himself
had become a scout, was used, but it had been
performed so many times since then that it
went off with a routine smoothness, free from
any of the little hitches that are apt to mar the
impressiveness of scout ceremonials. The
three patrols were grouped separately and
Mr. Ellsworth stood apart from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Garry, who, though an outsider, was
asked to participate, presented the applicant
to Tom.</p>
<p>The three simple requirements of the tenderfoot&mdash;familiarity
with the twelve laws and
the history of the American flag, and the
ability to tie four kinds of knots&mdash;had been
proved informally at Shady Lawn and it remained
only for Tom to read the laws one by
one, pausing after each and asking the applicant
if he agreed to accept it and abide by it.
Then Tom presented him to Mr. Ellsworth
and Harry, nervous but trying to be self-possessed,
made him the scout salute, then offered
him the hand-clasp, and then made the scout
sign, holding up his hand with the three fingers
upright.</p>
<p>Then he took the familiar scout oath, and
Tom stepped forward and pinned the tenderfoot
badge on him. Then the whole troop
filed past, each giving him the scout hand-clasp,
after which he stepped back with Tom
as the members of the Elk Patrol raised their
voices in unison, simulating the cry of the
elk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>And so the Elks, for whom the former
hoodlum of Barrel Alley had striven and
worked and planned, became a complete patrol
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All over but the shouting,&rdquo; said Roy, not
letting a minute elapse. &ldquo;Better to be a pro-ally
Elk than a German Silver Fox, hey?
Listen to the Ravens rave,&rdquo; he added, as that
patrol set up its familiar cry in honor of the
occasion. &ldquo;Some flock! Let&rsquo;s give the voice
of the package&mdash;I mean the pack. Come on,
Foxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Silver Foxes prided themselves on the
accuracy of their fox call, and the attenuated
&ldquo;Haa-haa&rdquo; resounded musically from the
hills around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said Ruth Stanton,
standing close to Garry and Raymond, who
were watching half enviously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
how they can do it. Did you have a call when
you had your patrol last summer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much of a call, it was kind of
a squeak,&rdquo; said Garry in his quiet way. &ldquo;We
called ourselves the &lsquo;Church Mice&rsquo; because
we were so poor. It wasn&rsquo;t very much of a
patrol and it all fizzled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that too bad! Why did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one fellow had to go away to school;
another moved out west, and&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t
know, it evaporated, sort of. You see, Edgevale
isn&rsquo;t much of a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to have a lake there,&rdquo; interrupted
Roy, &ldquo;but a bird stopped for a drink
one day and after that they couldn&rsquo;t find the
lake. Shows you what a big place it is&mdash;hey,
Garry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry laughed good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very far from where we live is Vale
Centre; Warrentown is near, too. That&rsquo;s
the county seat and they&rsquo;ve got a bully troop
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join that?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a full troop, and when a troop&rsquo;s
full it can&rsquo;t be any fuller. You just have to
start another and I guess I wasn&rsquo;t smart
enough&mdash;hey, Raymond? We&rsquo;re just free
lance scouts now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
as they&rsquo;ll call us scouts at all at National
Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should worry,&rdquo; called Roy, overhearing
scraps of their talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done something more than form a
patrol,&rdquo; Ruth said, soberly. &ldquo;You should
have heard what Dr. Brown said about you&mdash;and
my father and mother. That headquarters
wouldn&rsquo;t dare to say you aren&rsquo;t a scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they would&mdash;they&rsquo;re very brave.
They&rsquo;ve got heroes in there who&rsquo;d think no
more of cancelling an index card&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost as silly as Roy. But I
know you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a joke. I can see by
the way you look at them how you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a fine troop,&rdquo; Garry said, as he
watched the boys. &ldquo;Next to that troop in
Warrentown they&rsquo;re the best all-around troop
I ever saw&mdash;and you see some pretty good
ones up there at camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth told her mother that afternoon that
she liked Garry better than any of them&mdash;he
was so quiet and had such a funny way of
saying things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than Roy?&rdquo; Mrs. Stanton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Roy&rsquo;s so foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>But just the same, after the <i>Honor Scout</i>
had gone away, she missed Roy immensely.
Indeed, she missed them all; their brief stay
(entirely apart from the miraculous return
of her brother) had been a delightful event
in her life, and now with only the parrot to
relieve her loneliness, it seemed as if the bottom
had fallen out of things. Even the parrot
reminded her of Roy, for when she told
the bird that it was lonesome and slow at
Shady Lawn, he replied, &ldquo;You should worry!&rdquo;&mdash;a
phrase which he had never been
known to use before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">CRUISING IN THE &ldquo;HONOR SCOUT&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll get it this summer,&rdquo; said
Tom in his sober and rather awkward way.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you can never tell what you&rsquo;ll get.
I care more about all the members getting
them, anyway, and when we get twenty-one
we&rsquo;re an Eagle Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as an Eagle Patrol,
Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a scout is an Eagle Scout when he gets
twenty-one merit badges,&rdquo; said Tom, doggedly,
&ldquo;then a patrol is an Eagle Patrol when it
has twenty-one merit badges. I don&rsquo;t care
what National Headquarters says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ellsworth laughed. The patrol idea
was so firmly rooted in Tom&rsquo;s mind that he
could never think of the individual scout.
Rule or no rule, you couldn&rsquo;t pry that notion
out of his head with a crowbar. Everything
was for the glory and honor of the patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only one more to get yourself to be
a star scout, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got nine,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We got sixteen
in the patrol. If I get one more I&rsquo;ll be a
star scout as you call it. I&rsquo;d like the Gardening
Badge or the Automobile Badge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smallest flivvers thankfully received,
hey?&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>A half dozen or more of them were
sprawled upon the cabin roof as the <i>Honor
Scout</i> glided silently up the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merit badges are a cinch,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not either,&rdquo; said Connie
Bennet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, all you have to do for the Architecture
Badge is to build a castle in the air.
Know how to win the Astronomy Badge?&rdquo; he
asked, turning to little Raymond who was always
hugely amused at Roy&rsquo;s nonsense.
&ldquo;Jump out of a third-story window, land on
your head and see stars. The Aviation Badge
is easy, too. Fly up in the air when anybody
kids you&mdash;like Pee-wee. Know how to win
the Plumbers&rsquo; Badge? Just have a pipe
dream. Know how to win the Photography
Badge? Cultivate <i>taking</i> ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell some more,&rdquo; said Raymond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want the Blacksmith&rsquo;s Badge,
you just forge a check, and for the Business
Badge, mind your own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d <i>better</i> mind our business,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ellsworth, &ldquo;and slow down if we expect
to stop at West Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man the tiller, Pee,&rdquo; called Roy. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean <i>man</i> it, I mean <i>small boy</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paused for a visit at West Point,
where they were cordially received and shown
about. They saw the immaculate barracks,
watched the drill which was carried through
with the precision of clock-work, noted with
envy the erect posture and almost mechanical
salutes of the young officers, and Pee-wee, at
least, felt assured that the talk which he had
heard about unpreparedness was without
foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel like a tramp,&rdquo; said Will
Bronson, as they resumed their cruise, &ldquo;to see
all those swell uniforms and the way those
fellows stand and walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some class,&rdquo; agreed Roy, perched in his
usual place upon the combing.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellsworth, who was steering, laughed.
&ldquo;I guess they don&rsquo;t always look like
that,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Germany sinks many more of our ships,
they won&rsquo;t look like that,&rdquo; said Connie.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll put on khaki and roll up their
sleeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something,&rdquo; observed Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would <i>we</i> do if the country went to
war?&rdquo; asked Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move to the city,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like uniforms,&rdquo; said a timid voice, &ldquo;because
that shows what you are; a policeman
makes you feel safe and so does a soldier, because
they have their uniforms. It says in a
book I read, &lsquo;Show your colors&rsquo; and that
means, show what you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody turned and stared at little Raymond
Hollister who was sitting on the cabin
with his feet dangling in the cockpit. It was
not often that he spoke up. Indeed, he had
never seemed to be thoroughly at home with
anyone except Garry and Jeb Rushmore.
They all liked him for the quiet, odd little fellow
that he was. They seldom jollied him as
they did Pee-wee and they humored his prejudices
and notions when those became
known. He would sit, hour in and hour out,
quietly listening to their talk, laughing at
Roy&rsquo;s nonsense, and occasionally emboldened
to defend Garry against some bantering
charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Ray, old pal,&rdquo; said Roy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the suit that makes the scout. That&rsquo;s
a good slap at Tomasso; sling it into him,
Ray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth. (He
always hesitated to direct their arguments,
preferring to let them dope things out themselves.)
&ldquo;The uniform is only good for what
it means&mdash;as it seems to me. To be a scout
means certain things and to wear the uniform
says to the world that you are for those things.
So I&rsquo;m for the uniform. The uniform is the
scout&rsquo;s chief badge. It&rsquo;s just a great, big
merit badge and it ought to be worn like the
other merit badges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be an invisible badge,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed except Tom himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;An
invisible badge wouldn&rsquo;t be a badge at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be like a silent noise,&rdquo; said Roy,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the right idea, Raymond, <i>Show
your colors</i>. Rub it into him? He sold the
<i>Friday Evening Pest</i> all winter and he got
fifty cents twice a week for leading Miss
Wade&rsquo;s kindergarten class in physical torture;
gee, I think he&rsquo;s saving up to pay the national
debt, or something! And look at him with
that old book strap for a belt. Can you beat
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy&rsquo;s propensity for jollying, together
with his known fondness for Tom, made it
possible for him to say almost anything he
chose, and he never lost a chance to set people
good-naturedly by the ears. But you never
know where a spark is going to fall. If these
sparks of wit had fallen only upon Tom they
would have had no more effect than water,
for he knew Roy, and their friendship was as
a rock.</p>
<p>But they fell upon little Raymond Hollister,
where they ignited other sparks which
were already smouldering. Like many boys
who have been invalids and have been much
by themselves, Raymond had notions; away
back home he had first been attracted to the
scouts by the trim khaki regalia; it was the
first bait Garry had used with him, and to
Raymond at first a scout was simply a boy
who wore a khaki suit. With Garry&rsquo;s help,
the pale-faced little fellow had managed to
wriggle through the tenderfoot tests, and
then he wanted his suit. It was all he had
thought of. I dare say there are a few other
scouts like him. He had not delved very deeply
into the Handbook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The members of the little struggling patrol
had slipped away until there was no patrol,
but Raymond still wore his precious suit and
felt that he was a Boy Scout. Perhaps he had
the right idea, too, if you will just subtract
his prejudice. <i>Show your colors</i> is a good
slogan, but little Raymond went farther than
that. He assumed that if you didn&rsquo;t show
your colors it was because you didn&rsquo;t have
any; and like most scouts of the tenderfoot
class, he was a great stickler for the khaki, for
its own sweet sake.</p>
<p>He had (as he had confided to Pee-wee
that first night in camp) never &ldquo;fallen for&rdquo;
Tom Slade. There was not much of the scout
glamor about Tom and Raymond liked the
scout glamor. He worshipped Roy and he
idolized Garry. He was so jealous for Garry
that he looked on Tom as an unfair rival.
Who had sent that smudge signal from the
hill? Who had made Harry Stanton get better?
And who had been treated like a dog
during his whole vacation? Who but his
friend, Garry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>And who had taken Harry Stanton when
he <i>got</i> better, and broken up the little patrol
which was just starting up all over again?
Why, that was the fellow in the gray shirt
and the book-strap belt, who was no scout at
all&mdash;Tom Slade. Raymond knew what a
scout was&mdash;he had seen pictures enough of
them.</p>
<p>Probably, his diffident nature would have
kept him from saying more now except for
Roy&rsquo;s laughing encouragement and the belief
that Mr. Ellsworth stood with him. In
any event, he launched forth in a way which
astonished them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t wear the uniform&mdash;because
you&rsquo;re not a scout!&rdquo; he shouted at
Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too stingy, you are, and everybody
knows it! You&rsquo;ve no right to go with
fellers that are scouts! You&mdash;you get them
to name their boats after you&mdash;fellers&mdash;fellers
that you stole&mdash;yes, <i>stole</i>, you did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>It was unfortunate that both Mr. Ellsworth
and Garry, either of whom could have
smoothed this thing out in half a jiffy, were
on the forward deck getting the anchor ready
to cast, and the other scouts were too surprised,
and perhaps a little too amused, to put
a stop to his tirade. Probably they did not
think it would affect Tom.</p>
<p>But Raymond, losing all control of himself,
his eyes brimming and his voice trembling,
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because&mdash;you&mdash;you lived down in
an alley where people kill each other&mdash;and
burglars live&mdash;and men get drunk and you
don&rsquo;t know how other kinds of people act&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t.... And maybe, you stole other
things before&mdash;maybe you did&mdash;before you
ever <i>stole</i> Jeff&mdash;I mean Harry Stanton! <i>I</i>
wouldn&rsquo;t call you a scout with your old rags
on&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t. Scouts wear the uniform
and they don&rsquo;t steal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault,&rdquo; said Roy, as Connie vaulted
to the cabin edge and put his arm about
Raymond, trying to quiet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know about scouts&mdash;I do&mdash;and I know
what a scout is&mdash;I do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he shouted, almost
crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right, Ray,&rdquo; said Connie,
soothingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Tom Slade looked up, straight at Raymond.
He was gulping and it was pitiful to look at
him. &ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; he almost sobbed.
&ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Tom,&rdquo; said Roy, softly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him. He doesn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; Tom said again. &ldquo;But
you <i>can</i> have an invisible badge, just the same&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t care for Mr. Ellsworth or anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a supreme effort to control himself,
swallowing sob after sob in great painful
gulps, he pushed aside the cabin locker, went
down into the cabin and banged the door shut.</p>
<p>Roy followed after him, but Tom&rsquo;s stolid
nature had been pierced at last and he turned
away even from Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you can, Tom,&rdquo; said Roy, almost
frightened at his emotion. &ldquo;You <i>can</i>
have an invisible badge, Tom&mdash;I know you
can, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know exactly what Tom had
meant; like many of his expressions, it had
been a puzzle to them all, but he would have
said almost anything now to soothe him and
help to efface those black memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can, Tom,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy&mdash;old man. It&rsquo;s a cinch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">THE INVISIBLE BADGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens does he mean by an
invisible badge, do you suppose?&rdquo; Westy
Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go through <i>my</i> pockets,&rdquo; said
Roy. &ldquo;Tomasso is the Boy Scout puzzle.
They ought to give him away with a years
subscription to <i>Boys&rsquo; Life</i>. I wish that hadn&rsquo;t
happened, though. Jiminy, who&rsquo;d have
thought that kid would go up in the air like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom had not been long in regaining his
stolid composure; he appeared to entertain no
grudge against Raymond, and even offered to
bait his hook for him, for the little fellow
angled continually, notwithstanding that he
never caught anything. But his offer was indignantly
refused, and Raymond would have
nothing to do with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>The <i>Honor Scout</i> cruised leisurely up the
river, held at anchor for the scouts to swim
now and then, and making shore at safe places
when the tide was full, for luncheon or supper
on the wooded banks with the precipitous
mountains rising sheer above them.</p>
<p>Harry Stanton was hardly recognizable
now as the panic-stricken, scatter-brained
youth whom they had found on the mountain.
Under Mr. Ellsworth&rsquo;s eagle eye he had a
chance to show his skill at swimming, but
his wish to be ever in the water was discouraged
and for the most part he contented himself
with reading the Handbook and studying
the second-class tests. Already he had &ldquo;backfired&rdquo;
which was the word they used for the
act of qualifying for a merit badge before one
reached the stage where the scout rules would
permit him to receive such a badge.</p>
<p>This was in music. He had played a mandolin
in former days and now he had one of
those Hawaiian instruments&mdash;a Ukulele&mdash;and
he would sit on the cabin locker by the hour
picking out the soft South Sea airs, to the
delight of the whole troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>The dream of his life at present was to attain
to second-class, and he would talk eagerly
about tracking and signalling and first-aid.
His impulsiveness sometimes ran to the
point of agitation and he seemed to have little
balance wheel when he got excited, but he was
getting better fast and as the boys came to
know him for what he was they grew to like
him immensely.</p>
<p>In the course of their meanderings northward,
they came again to Catskill Landing
and Roy, Doc Carson and Pee-wee hiked up
to the camp to see how things were and to
get a sweater which Doc had left there, while
the others transferred some of the luggage
from the <i>Honor Scout</i> to the <i>Good Turn</i>, for
the Elks meant to continue in the smaller boat
so as to relieve the rather congested condition
of the other.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the three scouts returned,
Doc carrying the sweater on the end
of his staff like a pennant. Roy carried a
large jar of marmalade (or &ldquo;motherlade&rdquo; as
he called it) which the chief cook had presented
to the voyagers; and Pee-wee carried an extensive
scout smile. He was Law Eight, personified.</p>

<p class="center">DOC CARRIED THE SWEATER ON THE END OF HIS STAFF LIKE A PENNANT.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; called one of the group
that was lolling on the <i>Honor Scout&rsquo;s</i> cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The plot grows thinner,&rdquo; said Roy.
&ldquo;Here, take this and put it in the galley, compliments
of Beefsteak Ben.... Don&rsquo;t say a
word, a dark and bloody mystery has been
solved. Believe <i>me</i>, they&rsquo;ve got a sleuth up
there that has Tom beaten forty-&rsquo;leven ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s everybody?&rdquo; Will Bronson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s two troops
there from Boston&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to see the beans that crowd
eats,&rdquo; Roy interrupted; &ldquo;and mince pie&mdash;go-o-odnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bunch came from Brooklyn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you blame them?&rdquo; interrupted Roy
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a troop from Canada&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daon&rsquo;tcher knaow,&rdquo; interrupted Roy,
with an exaggerated imitation of the English
accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s some troop,&rdquo; said Doc. &ldquo;They
came from Montreal and they wear trousers
that don&rsquo;t tuck in and show part of their legs
and they wear little silver swastika badges that
they get for special service. They look awfully
different from the other fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They showed us how to raise the English
flag,&rdquo; said Pee-wee, excitedly. &ldquo;Maybe you
think the English flag hasn&rsquo;t got any top and
bottom to it. Anybody can tell when the
American flag is upside down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should hope so,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe you think because the English
flag has a center design that you can&rsquo;t
fly it upside down&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re
wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that any of us is wrong since
none of us has committed that crime,&rdquo; laughed
Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in the habit of
flying the British flag at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; boasted Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t blame us for your sins,&rdquo;
chuckled the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>Pee-wee subsided for the moment, but the
time was to come, and that not so far distant,
when this redoubtable &ldquo;good turner&rdquo; should
enter stores and even public buildings, in
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s domain, and do the British Empire
a good turn by explaining how her proud
emblem was being flown without, upside
down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been doing war work,&rdquo; said Doc.
&ldquo;They built recruiting stands in Montreal,
and they sand-papered three thousand muskets
that had to be varnished, and distributed enlistment
posters, and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I don&rsquo;t know
what all. They showed us a poster like the
ones they distributed. It said &lsquo;Meet me at
the battle-line.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet me at the clothes-line, that&rsquo;s where
I hang out!&rdquo; put in Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re one peach of a troop!&rdquo; enthused
Pee-wee.</p>
<p>This troop of Canadian scouts had produced
a great impression on the three boys,
and, from their account, had done the same
on all the others at Temple Camp. The
three were full of enthusiasm for their wide-awakeness
and efficiency, to say nothing of
their patriotic activities. It started the
Bridgeboro boys thinking of what part they
might be permitted to play if Uncle Sam were
drawn into the great war.</p>
<p>These Canadian youngsters, according to
Doc, had shown the greatest friendliness toward
their American brothers, standing with
hats removed when the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i>
was sung, and had become very popular in
camp, and shown an almost uncanny proficiency
in tracking and the faculty for deduction.
One of their patrol leaders, indeed, was a
veritable hand-writing expert, and knew besides
dozens of scout signs used in the Canadian
Rockies. But it fell out that he did Tom
Slade a very bad turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>The enthusiastic report of the boys had two
very marked effects upon the party, one of
which they would be destined to recall in
strenuous days to come. These were their
admiration for the fine organization and superb
proficiency of the English scouts, and
for the manner in which they were &ldquo;doing
their bit&rdquo; for their country in these days of
trial. It seemed to bring the Bridgeboro
boys very near to the war.</p>
<p>Garry, who sat quietly upon the combing
listening to Doc&rsquo;s account, with occasional
spasmodic punctuations by Pee-wee, thought
regretfully of his own efforts to form a little
troop, and of how meagre and discouraging
the results had been beside these splendidly
organized scout units with which it seemed his
fate to mingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about the mystery?&rdquo; Connie
Bennet prompted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;The mystery
is all right, all right, and it proves the good
old rule that your sins are sure to find you
out. I hold here an envelope to be delivered
to Tomasso Slade&mdash;main geezer of the Elks.
Stand, Tomasso, so I can get a good shot at
you! <i>Who sent the money for Raymond Hollister
to stay at camp till September?</i>&rdquo; he
shouted, suddenly. &ldquo;And you thought you&rsquo;d
get away with it, didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;you big sneak!
Deny it at your peril! <i>Now</i> I know where
the profits from the <i>Friday Evening Pest</i>
went! There&rsquo;s a fellow&mdash;Rolly Culver, from
Montreal, Canada&mdash;who has <i>your</i> number, all
right! Deny the allegation and denounce the
alligator, if you dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody stared at Tom, who was blushing
right up to the roots of his towsled shock
of rebellious hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said he, sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well may you ask what I mean, Sherlock
Nobody Holmes!&rdquo; triumphed Roy, shaking
the envelope exasperatingly in Tom&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;I mean that you tried to beat Mr. John
Temple to it&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I mean! And Rolly
Culver from Canada FOILED you! See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, glancing shamefacedly
across the deck at little Raymond and
looking as if he had committed a crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s good we hiked up there,&rdquo; said
Roy, more seriously. &ldquo;A check got there
yesterday from Mr. Temple&mdash;a check for
fifty bucks&mdash;mailed in the West Indies. It
was for Raymond to stay at camp till fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go-o-odni-ght!&rdquo; exclaimed Will Bronson.</p>
<p>Garry stared, intensely interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have heard Jeb tell about
it,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;&lsquo;When I see es haow they follyed
one anuther up,&rsquo;&rdquo; he went on, accurately
mimicking Jeb. &ldquo;&lsquo;I sez thar&rsquo; must be sump&rsquo;n
wrong somewhar.&rsquo; And just by chance,&rdquo; Roy
continued, &ldquo;he hauled out of his old buckskin
wallet the old crumpled piece of paper that
had come with the other money&mdash;the fifty
buckarinos in cash&mdash;and it&rsquo;s lucky he happened
to show it to that Culver kid, believe <i>me</i>!
That fellow said it was the same writing as the
writing on the bulletin board at camp. Other
fellows said, no; but he stuck to it and showed
them how to compare curves and letters, and
strokes and dots and things&mdash;even straight
lines&mdash;and there you are,&rdquo; concluded Roy, delightedly.
&ldquo;We all know who had charge of
the bulletin board&mdash;&mdash; And you thought you&rsquo;d
make Mr. Temple the goat, didn&rsquo;t you, with
your two twenties and a ten! You thought
he&rsquo;d forgotten Raymond, didn&rsquo;t you. And
you thought you&rsquo;d get away with it! We&rsquo;ve
got your number, Tomasso, my boy, and we
know why you&rsquo;ve been wearing old gray flannel
shirts and book straps, and things. Here
you are&mdash;there&rsquo;s your fifty!&rdquo; he concluded,
throwing the envelope triumphantly in Tom&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;It would have gone back to Mr.
Temple if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Rolly Culver and
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>There was no mistaking Roy&rsquo;s overwhelming
delight, despite his denunciatory tone and
he watched joyously as Tom, distressed and
uncomfortable, in face of the whole troop&rsquo;s
stare, tore open the envelope and took out two
twenties and a ten. For Roy had asked the
camp trustees who cashed the check to return
Tom&rsquo;s money in just the form in which he had
sent it, when, having seen the Temples start
for South America, he had gone to the post-office
at home in Bridgeboro, and with characteristic
disregard of the risk, had sent his
whole savings in cash to Temple Camp, that
nature might complete the good work she had
begun for little Raymond Hollister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;d find out,&rdquo; said
Tom doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you did,&rdquo; laughed Mr.
Ellsworth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;John Temple spoiled it for you,&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get the best of that man!&rdquo;
shouted Pee-wee. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said Garry, simply, &ldquo;I was always
glad I turned Stanton over to you, but now
I&rsquo;m gladder than ever. You can see yourself
what you&rsquo;ve done for Raymond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we can all see what kind of a pal
Raymond has, too,&rdquo; Roy shot back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be leader of a swell patrol some day, Garry,
or I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry only smiled. &ldquo;All things come
round to him who waits,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.
&ldquo;If there was a merit badge for this sort of
thing you&rsquo;d be a star scout tomorrow. Come
over here, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faintest reminder of the old
hoodlum shuffle in Tom&rsquo;s clumsy gait as he
went sheepishly across the deck and leaned
against the boat&rsquo;s rail near his scoutmaster,
speechless, almost expressionless. The book-strap
was drawn absurdly tight around his
waist. The old, worn, faded gray flannel
shirt that he wore was a sight. But upon the
back of it, such as it was, Mr. Ellsworth administered
a resounding slap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you meant by an invisible
badge, hey?&rdquo; said Westy, suddenly; &ldquo;a good
turn kept secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid none of us have quite understood
Tom,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, simply.
Then he turned and looked with the winningest
smile at little Raymond. &ldquo;None of us
have understood him, have we, Ray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Raymond, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it shows us that being a scout means
more than just wearing the scout suit, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, one can be a very good scout in a
very ragged shirt, and he can, if he wishes to,
be a very punk scout in full khaki. You get
me, Ray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what are we going to do about
it?&rdquo; Mr. Ellsworth asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>Garry understood, if Raymond did not, for
he started the little fellow over toward Tom,
and Tom took the timid hand and held it.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, in one of those freaks of
impulse that Raymond sometimes showed, he
reached with his other hand and grasped
Tom&rsquo;s arm. With the arm that was free
Tom encircled the small, agitated form.</p>
<p>Raymond was crying like a baby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">LOST!</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve decided, do you
know what I&rsquo;ve decided?&rdquo; demanded Pee-wee,
uproariously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it to us gently and let us hear the
worst,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided that we ought to stop in Albany
and have Tom buy a suit. I didn&rsquo;t say anything
before, but crinkums, he ought not to go
to Plattsburg without a suit. You can see that
yourself. And he can get one now, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that, Tom?&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
quizzically.</p>
<p>They were running up the stretch of river
above Castleton and would reach the capital
that day, if their plans held good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got no objections to getting a suit,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;I believe in suits. I never said I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The <i>Good Turn</i> had run up alongside the
<i>Honor Scout</i> which had come to anchor for
swimming and luncheon, and Tom and his
patrol had gone aboard the larger boat for
&ldquo;eats,&rdquo; where an uproarious session of jollying
usually awaited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Sigmund Eisner!&rdquo; shouted
Roy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the fellow that makes scouts,
hey, Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Raymond, quite boldly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the fellow that makes <i>suits</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing, only different,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we all believe in the khaki,&rdquo; said
Mr. Ellsworth, &ldquo;only we know it&rsquo;s not the
khaki that makes the scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more than it&rsquo;s the pants that make
the panther, or the badge that makes the
badger,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;I vote for Tom to buy
a suit and we&rsquo;ll all go with him to help him
choose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, with an actual
approach to animation. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t buy it if
the whole troop goes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t kid you,&rdquo; said Connie. &ldquo;Honest,
we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear what Bennover Connet says? We&rsquo;ll
promise to be good and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take no chances,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind if two or three go, so&rsquo;s to help me get
fitted right, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One representative from each patrol,&rdquo;
suggested Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tom, resignedly.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon they
reached Albany and tied up at a lumber
wharf right under the shadow of the big night
boat, the majestic bulk of which made the
<i>Good Turn</i> and even the more imposing
<i>Honor Scout</i> look very insignificant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a fling on shore,&rdquo; shouted Roy.
&ldquo;Hand me something till I fling it on shore,&rdquo;
he added, hitching his trousers in true mariner&rsquo;s
fashion.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Tom&rsquo;s going to treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy, being the leader of the Silver Foxes,
represented that patrol in the suit-buying expedition;
Tom represented his own patrol,
and Artie Van Arlen, leader of the Ravens
(of whom you shall know more in another
volume) completed the trio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Correct imitation of a boy scout hunting
for an ice cream soda,&rdquo; said Roy, climbing
stealthily over the lumber pile and picking
his way up to the street. &ldquo;Gee, it seems funny
to be in a city, doesn&rsquo;t it? What are all the
flags for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What flags?&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flag<i>stones</i>&mdash;you&rsquo;re walking on &rsquo;em. No
sooner said than stung!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bites like a sunfish,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>It did not take them long to reach a thoroughfare
where their tanned faces and jaunty,
out-of-town air attracted no little attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they know we&rsquo;re just fresh from
a life on the ocean wave,&rdquo; suggested Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can see we&rsquo;re fresh, all right,&rdquo; said
Roy. &ldquo;We should worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first confectionery store which they
came to they lined up at the soda counter
from behind which a white-jacketed man
smiled at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a raspberry sundae,&rdquo; said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;V&mdash;vanilla,&rdquo; said Tom, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take heliotripe&mdash;trope,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>The man waited, laughing good-naturedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to make up my mind,&rdquo; Roy
went on, studying the tempting printed list.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t mad, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;No, indeed, I&rsquo;m
glad you&rsquo;re so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not happy,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;We laugh,
ha-ha, and dance ha-ha, but we&rsquo;re not happy.
I think I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;I think
I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;<i>chocolate</i>. Happy thought, that&rsquo;s
my patrol color!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom paid for the sodas and Roy bought
some peanut brittle. The man smiled after
them as they went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives on the island seem to be
friendly,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Artie, &ldquo;picking
out your patrol color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to write to
National Headquarters and tell them to print
a rule in the Handbook&mdash;next edition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what an edition is? You
know what a dish is? Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rule</i>,&rdquo; said Artie. &ldquo;&lsquo;Scouts buying sodas
should always select their own patrol colors&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;Good idea. Tom
would always take raspberry, I&rsquo;d take chocolate,
and you&rsquo;d take&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a big dry goods store,&rdquo; said
Artie.</p>
<p>They cut across the street and entering a
large store, asked where scout supplies were
sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two aisles to your right, then one to your
left,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get you,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>Reaching the point indicated, and seeing
no scout supplies, they asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two aisles down and take the elevator to
the third floor; then two aisles forward,&rdquo; said
a young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank you,&rdquo; said Roy, bowing
elaborately.</p>
<p>Having followed these directions and seeing
no scout supplies, they inquired of another
clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the basement,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>
<p>The three tramped back and down the
stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your scout smile on,&rdquo; said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts, I think we&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; said Roy, &ldquo;and
darkness is coming on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the basement they saw tents and canoes
in the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a scout camp in the wilds of a
department store,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;Are you getting
tired, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet Jeb Rushmore could find it all
right,&rdquo; said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something; but I think we&rsquo;re hot
on the trail now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the spot which looked like a
camp, they asked for scout suits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want supplies,&rdquo; said the young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right the first time,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are on the fourth floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three sank down in one of those swinging
porch benches and breathed heavily,
much to the girl&rsquo;s amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we blaze the trail,&rdquo; said
Roy, &ldquo;so other scouts will be able to follow
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems there&rsquo;s a difference between
camping goods and sporting articles,&rdquo; said
Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s not give up,&rdquo; contributed Tom.</p>
<p>They rose and sallied laughingly forth,
through aisles and around corners to the elevator.
On the fourth floor they found themselves
in a wilderness of carpets and rugs and
bureaus, tables, chairs and curtains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This beats the hill where we found Stan,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a good heart, scouts,&rdquo; said Roy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come out all right yet. This has got
the Canadian Rockies beat twenty ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sporting supplies?&rdquo; pleaded Roy of the
first clerk they saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two aisles over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scout suits?&rdquo; he asked, reaching that
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One floor down, in the boy&rsquo;s clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the stairway they encountered a
friendly looking man in black, standing with
his hands clasped behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, mister,&rdquo; said Roy, &ldquo;we are boy
scouts and we&rsquo;re lost. It&rsquo;s getting late and we
have to get back to our boat before dark. We
can&rsquo;t seem to hit the right trail and we&rsquo;re
afraid we&rsquo;ll starve if night comes on. We
want to find the place where they sell scout
suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed pleasantly and resting
his arm over Roy&rsquo;s shoulder, went part way
down the stairs with them and pointed to a
scout suit on a wooden form at the other side
of the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thank you,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose sight of it,&rdquo; suggested Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Reaching the elusive spot, they found
themselves at last at the haven of their desire,
for there was the wooden boy scout facing
them, his stiff arm raised and his painted
fingers sticking upright in the scout salute, as
if to greet the tired wayfarers, who sank
down, panting ostentatiously, upon a bench
close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we agree not to tell the
fellows that we were lost and&mdash;and&mdash;asked
our way?&rdquo; said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the three
leaders and no one knows it but us. We&rsquo;ll
keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Pee-wee should ever hear of this,&rdquo; said
Roy, &ldquo;and find out that we <i>asked our way</i>&mdash;G-o-o-dni-ight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAGIC ADVENTURE OF THE FRECKLED SCOUT</span></h2>
<p>The salesman was busy waiting on two
boys, both scouts, one of whom was evidently
buying a new outfit. Tom expressed surprise
at this, since the uniform which he was wearing
seemed almost new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the new one is for Sundays,&rdquo;
said Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should worry,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>The boy who was doing the purchasing
was of a trim physique, with very red hair
and he had as many freckles upon his cheerful
countenance as there are stars in the quiet
sky. There was much joking, which the
Bridgeboro boys could not hear, between
these boys and the salesman, and while waiting
for the purchase to be wrapped the three
formed a little laughing group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>The freckled boy, in particular, interested
the waiting scouts who were attracted by his
trim figure, his jaunty manner and the shiny
redness of his rather curly hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you luck,&rdquo; said the salesman
as they left him; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some stunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two passed the bench where the
Bridgeboro boys were sitting, the red-headed
boy turned and gave them the scout salute
with a merry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live around here?&rdquo; Artie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the salesman, inspecting Tom&rsquo;s
scout certificate to be sure that he was entitled
to buy the official suit. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re down from
their camp up Lake Champlain. Quite a
pair, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Artie felt that he would like to ask more
about them, for he was sure they had been
telling &ldquo;their adventures,&rdquo; as Pee-wee would
have said, to the salesman. But scouts are
not officious, and these particular scouts believed
somewhat in Roy&rsquo;s advice for winning
the business badge; <i>viz.</i>, Mind your own
business.</p>
<p>The salesman, however, did vouchsafe
them one little morsel of information while
he was fitting Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a great scheme on foot, those
kids,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what it is,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to give a scout suit to a new
fellow for a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock Nobody Holmes again,&rdquo; jeered
Roy.</p>
<p>The man only laughed. &ldquo;You scout fellows
don&rsquo;t seem to know what fear is, do
you?&rdquo; he added, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t know it if we met it in the
street,&rdquo; said Roy, not, however, understanding
the significance of the remark. &ldquo;Tomasso&rsquo;s
the courageousest&mdash;look out he don&rsquo;t bite you!
We&rsquo;ve been feeding him meat today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom loosened up and decided he would
get a sweater, too, and the joint deliberation
over a suitable color put an end to their immediate
thought of the stranger scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of a blackish white would be
good,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>Artie suggested a pale lavender. The
salesman was greatly amused at their talk,
but Tom was somewhat nettled and embarrassed,
and he was glad when the completion
of the business put an end to their nonsense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>On the way back to the boats and afterwards
they speculated somewhat about the
two scouts. There was no particular reason
for their doing so except that the red-headed
boy lingered in their minds with his trim appearance
and his vivacious manner. Later,
they recalled his jaunty, careless air, his
friendly salute and his winning smile, almost
with a shudder.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;We saw the kind of scout that Raymond
believes in,&rdquo; taunted Roy, upon their return
to the boats. &ldquo;He had on the full uniform,
belt-axe, whistle, bugle, gaiters, hat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, winking
at Raymond. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re for&mdash;to
be worn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was only one thing wrong with
him,&rdquo; Roy concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Raymond, quite boldly
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was made of wood,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let him serve as a terrible example,&rdquo;
laughed the scoutmaster. &ldquo;I dare
say there are a few others like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have any invisible badges on?&rdquo;
Doc asked slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Tomasso look too sweet for anything?&rdquo;
teased Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out,&rdquo; grumbled Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time
to get supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stayed at their mooring that night
and lolled about on the cabin roof of the
<i>Honor Scout</i> while Harry Stanton strummed
his ukulele and those who knew the soft music
of the far-off Pacific isles hummed the airs
which seem nowhere so melodious as on the
water. A group of small boys from the unkempt
waterside section caught the strains
and shuffled down, grimy and ragged, to
sprawl upon the piles of lumber on the wharf,
staring with wide open eyes, and listening.
To them it was like a circus come to town.
To the scouts it was a new kind of camp fire.</p>
<p>In the morning they were gone, doubtless
leaving a refreshing memory with the youthful
denizens of that squalid neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Hudson above Troy is no longer of
majestic beauty and the voyagers were not
sorry for the novelty which presented when
they entered the canal. At least, they did not
have to &ldquo;squint&rdquo; for hidden perils, though
the locks played sorry havoc with the beautiful
enameled freeboard of the <i>Honor Scout</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruising in a canal is about as exciting
as a hike on Broadway,&rdquo; commented Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You said something,&rdquo; agreed Connie.</p>
<p>It was not long, indeed, before the novelty
began to wear off, and they were one and all
glad when the boats emerged into the broad
expanse of Lake Champlain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lake Champlain,&rdquo; said Roy, contemplating
it in his favorite attitude, sitting on the
cabin roof with his hands clasped about his
updrawn knees; &ldquo;Lake Champlain rises early
in the morning, takes a northerly course, and
flows into the sink. Correct, be seated, Master
Blakeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could accelerate their speed now
and the <i>Good Turn</i> had her work cut out for
her keeping up, even with the <i>Honor Scout&rsquo;s</i>
motor throttled down to half-speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is historic territory,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.
&ldquo;Almost every rock has its tale to tell
of the bloody French and Indian War&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t tell them,&rdquo; said Roy.
&ldquo;School&rsquo;s closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for all that he was interested as &ldquo;our
beloved scoutmaster&rdquo; recalled some of the
stirring events which occurred along the
rugged, historic shores between which they
were passing. They paused to see the ruins
of the old Revolutionary fort at Crown Point,
and the restored fort at Ticonderoga, with
its underground passage to the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>The first night of their cruise through the
lake they tied up at Port Henry and early
in the morning sallied forth into the town for
oil, gasoline and supplies, replenishing their
depleted stock sufficiently for the fifty mile
run up to Plattsburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe <i>me</i>, this is some hike,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it looks about the same,&rdquo; mused
Mr. Ellsworth, glancing about at the wild
shore, &ldquo;as it did when Champlain sailed
through it with his Indian guides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was sumpty-sump years ago,&rdquo; said
Artie Van Arlen, &ldquo;you have him in the third
grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he stopped at Port Henry for gasoline,&rdquo;
suggested Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he didn&rsquo;t have to pay twenty-three
cents for it,&rdquo; said Connie.</p>
<p>For about fifteen miles above Port Henry
the lake is comparatively narrow, then it
opens up to a breadth of ten miles or more,
becoming a veritable inland-sea, with the
rolling hills of Vermont reaching far eastward
and merging in the distance with the
lofty Green Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>About ten miles above Port Henry, and at
the narrowest part of the lake&rsquo;s narrow stretch,
there rises upon the New York side an extent
of precipitous and rugged height known
as the Split Rock Mountain. On the landward
side the slope from the mountain is easy
enough, but toward the lake this irregular
eminence presents a steep surface interspersed
with woody patches and gray rock.
Nestling under this forbidding height is a
narrow area of marshy woodland between it
and the shore.</p>
<p>It is related that in the olden days a Mohawk
warrior, being pursued and finding himself
upon this dizzy summit without an arrow
to his bow, tried to scramble down and losing
his foothold was precipitated against trees
and over rocks and his mangled body became
a prey to vultures in the wooded swamp
below. There are guides about that historic
water who can point you where his skeleton
and tomahawk were found&mdash;if you are disposed
to venture within that tangled morass.</p>
<p>As the little flotilla approached this spot,
Tom who was steering the smaller boat noticed
a green canoe drawn up at the wood&rsquo;s edge,
and he called to Roy, sprawling on the cabin
of the <i>Honor Scout</i>, to look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a canoe all right, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; answered Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same color as the woods, that&rsquo;s why
you can&rsquo;t see it plainer,&rdquo; said Will Bronson,
looking through the field glass.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he spoken when two scouts
emerged at the shore and busied themselves
at the canoe for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the red-headed fellow we saw
in Albany!&rdquo; said Artie, who had taken the
glass. &ldquo;I can see him plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; added Roy. &ldquo;You can recognize
him without the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts on the larger boat passed the
glass from one to another, though most of
them could distinguish the boy without it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hair is as red as a brick, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, all right,&rdquo; said Tom, ungrammatically,
from the other boat.</p>
<p>They were almost abreast of the spot when
the two boys disappeared in the woods. Roy
had meant to hail them and perhaps would
still have done so but for the fact that the
freckled scout presently reappeared alone
climbing up the precipitous slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;s going to try to
climb that, do you?&rdquo; Mr. Ellsworth queried
as he watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way,&rdquo; said Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where the other fellow is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other scout did not appear, and they
watched the agile form as it scrambled up the
almost sheer face of the mountain. The sunlight
was falling upon the dull face of rock
and touching the sparse vegetation with its
bright glow, and they recognized the boy
clearly now, even to his red hair which shone
when it caught the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;some stunt!&rdquo; exclaimed
Garry, in amazement. &ldquo;Do you suppose their
camp is up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to call themselves the Eagles,
if it is,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch him,&rdquo; called Tom from the other
boat.</p>
<p>The eyes of the whole troop were upon the
nimble figure as it worked its way upward,
now scrambling, now climbing among trees,
now going zigzag over a precipitous area.</p>
<div class="img" id="p225">
<img src="images/p225.jpg" alt="THE EYES OF THE WHOLE TROOP WERE UPON THE NIMBLE FIGURE AS IT WORKED ITS WAY UPWARD." width="500" height="779" />
<p class="center">THE EYES OF THE WHOLE TROOP WERE UPON THE NIMBLE FIGURE AS IT WORKED ITS WAY UPWARD.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some monkey, hey?&rdquo; called Garry, to the
boys in the smaller boat, where Harry Stanton
watched, fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some scout, all right,&rdquo; one of the O&rsquo;Connor
boys called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a most amazing feat,&rdquo; said the
scoutmaster, watching with the glass.</p>
<p>Soon the agile form, verging to right or
left to follow a path of less resistance and
sometimes pausing to use his brains as a scout
should, had reached a little clump of freakish
trees, growing out of rock, and for a few moments
he was hidden from the distant
watchers.</p>
<p>They had shut off the power of both boats
and lay drifting. A scout is brother to every
other scout, and I dare say the whole party
took a pride in the scout who dared attempt so
hazardous an undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see it in his face,&rdquo; Tom said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock Nobody Holmes again,&rdquo; called
Roy from the other boat.</p>
<p>Presently, the scrambling figure emerged
upon the bare surface above, wriggling and
bracing itself on what seemed to be mere
points of rock. A few yards more and he
would be safe upon the wooded summit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, anticipating
an impulse on Roy&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;You might
rattle him. Wait till he&rsquo;s out of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now he had reached the edge of the woods
which covered the summit and extended
somewhat down the precipitous side, and as he
disappeared among the trees the scouts on the
lake sent up a lusty cheer.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the echo of their shout died
away when Roy jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Following his pointing finger, the whole
troop stood aghast in utter horror as they saw
the limp and sprawling figure of the freckled
scout go tumbling headlong over tree and rock
down the rugged precipice. Harry Stanton
gasped and almost fainted away. Pee-wee
grasped the rail, white as a sheet.</p>
<p>The figure fell against a crooked tree, the
limp arms of the apparently dead or unconscious
boy making no effort to grasp it, then
tumbled headlong from the ledge and fell
with a sickening impact upon the jagged
rocks below. There it paused for a second,
then fell again like a dead weight, over sheer
walls of rock. Once again it paused against
some obstacle and Mr. Ellsworth, watching
with the glass, could see the neck hanging
limp, the head far back in a ghastly, unnatural
attitude. The boy was evidently quite dead.
Again the body fell, the loose arms and limbs
sprawling this way and that until it was precipitated
over the edge of the lowest rocky
wall and the dreadful sight was ended by its
disappearance into the swampy woods below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have lost his foothold,&rdquo; whispered
Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; breathed little Raymond,
almost in a panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the oars,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, quietly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll row ashore. Cast the anchor,&rdquo;
he called. &ldquo;We may be able to get the body.
That&rsquo;s about all we can do, I&rsquo;m afraid. He
probably lost his life with the first impact.
He was dead long before he reached the
bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a scout among them but was
sobered by the dreadful thing; Harry Stanton
had lost his nerve entirely; and it was a solemn
little group that scrambled into the
<i>Honor Scout&rsquo;s</i> skiff and rowed for shore.
Garry Everson, who was a better swimmer
than any member of the Bridgeboro troop, had
already thrown off his outer clothing and was
well toward shore. Others, for whom there
was not room in the skiff, followed swimming,
until only Harry Stanton, Raymond, and
Westy Martin whom Mr. Ellsworth had
asked to remain with them, were left on the
smaller boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that hill near camp,&rdquo; Garry
called to the boys in the approaching boat.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular everglades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the place a veritable maze of
tangled swamp, with a spongy, uncertain
foothold. In toward the hill the land was
firmer but at close range and without an open
view it was impossible to determine where the
body had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you point out about where it was?&rdquo;
called Roy, from the shore.</p>
<p>Westy pointed as best he could and the
shore party, spreading, began a systematic
search of the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo; said Doc who, as a
matter of general precaution, had his first-aid
case slung over his shoulder. He was standing
on the brink of a black pool, which they
thought to be right under the spot where the
body had fallen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I see how deep it is,&rdquo; said Garry,
wading in. He was soon beyond his depth
and swimming. &ldquo;If he fell in <i>there</i> we&rsquo;ll
never get him,&rdquo; he said, emerging with black
slime dripping from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he caught in the branches of some
of those trees,&rdquo; suggested Connie.</p>
<p>It was the signal for several scouts to
scramble up among the knotty branches of
the trees in toward the precipice, but without
result.</p>
<p>They scoured the whole treacherous ground
for fifty yards or more in every direction, but
no sign of the unfortunate boy&rsquo;s body could
they discover. They lashed together the
two oars from the boat, making a length of
perhaps twenty feet, and probed the pool but
found nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dive into that,&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d better, my boy,&rdquo; said
Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>But Garry had already dived and came up
dripping with mud and slime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get to the bottom,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;there <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> any bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Tom Slade who, as usual, had pursued his
own way, called to the others, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kind
of a trail here&mdash;a pearl necklace,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
I should think. It runs through this swamp and up
around the side there. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy and Mr. Ellsworth, who had come
close to him, saw what he meant, though it is
doubtful if even those good scouts would have
recognized it as a trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;you can get to the top
without that climb. This runs up around
where it isn&rsquo;t so steep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was a sort of zigzag
trail, becoming plainer as it wound its way
up, by which one might ascend by a longer
though safer route. It followed a deep cleft
in the rocks and led, as they surmised, to the
easier slope on the landward side of the
mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he take that path, do you
suppose?&rdquo; said the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he was a dare-devil,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellsworth stood silently as Tom and
Roy started up the trail. It led them, as they
had supposed it would, to a broader path by
which the hill could be surmounted. Here
were indistinct footprints at intervals. Why
they were not regular Tom could not imagine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> the fellow go this way, I wonder?&rdquo;
Roy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answered that yourself,&rdquo; Tom answered.</p>
<p>They were now upon the summit and could
look down and see the two boats side by side
in the lake. It was a dizzy height. Behind
them was a broad, flat plateau which became
a gentle slope and fell away into the lower
country beyond. The path crossed this and
here the footprints were plainer and more
regular. Then they verged from the path and
were difficult to follow amid the sparse vegetation
of the plateau.</p>
<p>A few yards and they ended abruptly at a
point where there was a little disturbance of
the earth and what Tom and Roy thought to
be the imprints, very faint, of rubber tires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been an auto here,&rdquo; said
Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been one of those motor-cycle
affairs with a kind of a baby carriage
alongside it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Those prints are
too close together for a regular auto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could an auto or a motor-cycle get
up here, anyway?&rdquo; queried Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>From the spot where they happened to be,
they could just manage to trace a second line
of footprints coming from another direction.</p>
<p>Roy was very much sobered by this whole
affair, but he could not refrain from his usual
comment, &ldquo;The plot grows thinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s follow those,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>They did so until the prints ended abruptly
upon the flat, rocky surface near the edge
of the precipice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of the whole
business,&rdquo; said Roy. &ldquo;Blamed if I do! It&rsquo;s a
puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said Tom, as they started down
again, &ldquo;is this; the other fellow was down
there below somewhere and was going to follow
that fellow, when all of a sudden he fell.
They must have chosen that way just for a
stunt, I suppose. Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear that
red-headed fellows are reckless? It might
possibly be,&rdquo; he added, hesitatingly, &ldquo;that the
other fellow managed to get his&mdash;his body and
drag it around up this way. That might account
for the way that path looked back there;
if someone had been dragged along it might
sort of wipe out the footprints. I don&rsquo;t see
how he could have got so far ahead of us,
though,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where could he have taken the&mdash;body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;unless he managed to carry
it to that automobile or whatever it was back
there. Maybe they&rsquo;d left some kind of a car
there to go out on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all that wouldn&rsquo;t account for those
other footprints we saw out toward the edge,&rdquo;
said Roy, skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;unless the other fellow
went out there and tried to find out, maybe,
how the dead fellow had happened to fall.
Maybe a tree that he had hold of broke&mdash;or
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there ought to be footprints back,&rdquo;
said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;there were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t saying they weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomasso, you&rsquo;re a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only how did they ever get an automobile,
or a motor baby carriage or whatever you
call it, up to that place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s got me,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p class="tb">They found their companions still searching,
but almost discouraged, and Mr. Ellsworth
listened with keen interest to Roy&rsquo;s
report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; said he, soberly; &ldquo;you say you
saw wheel imprints? Were there no wheel
tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but the land was grassy
in places and it was pretty hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; was all that Mr. Ellsworth
could say. &ldquo;I think the most likely view is
that the body is at the bottom of that bottomless
pool,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we
can do anything else, boys. It goes against
me to go on without finding the poor fellow&rsquo;s
body, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scouts do not give up easily and they did
not leave the spot until it was too dark to see.
Then they went back to the boats, a muddy,
dishevelled, scratched and discouraged band.
They did not take kindly to defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest town,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
looking at their map, &ldquo;is Boquet. Farther
up, on the Vermont side, is Burlington. I suggest
that we stop at both those places and
notify the scouts and the authorities. With
a grappling iron they could probably get the
body.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Tom listened with stolid indifference to
this apparent repudiation of his own theory.
Probably he did not think the matter worth
discussing for in either case the freckled scout
was dead.</p>
<p>There was no music on the cabin roof of
the <i>Good Turn</i> that night and the Silver
Foxes and Ravens who lolled about on the
<i>Honor Scout</i> did not call for it, as they usually
did. Mr. Ellsworth stood quietly at the
wheel; the others sat or lay about, sober and
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so quiet, Roy?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Roy, who squatted in
his characteristic position. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to
get that fellow out of my head&mdash;and&mdash;and the
way he saluted us back there in Albany. Gee,
I can almost hear him laughing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s Burlington where the lights
are,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth. &ldquo;Throttle her
down to half, Roy, and throw your lead to see
how much water we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;SO LONG&mdash;SEE YOU LATER!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>It was the afternoon of the following day
when the little flotilla, running past the island
of Valcour, sighted a promontory straight
ahead and a little later discovered it to be
the embracing arm which forms the outer
boundary of Cumberland Bay.</p>
<p>As they sailed into this spacious haven they
could see, a little to the northwest, a large field
dotted with innumerable tents, which on
closer view they saw to be arranged with the
utmost squareness and precision, in
avenues.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
Their first sight of the famous training
camp made Temple Camp seem very insignificant
indeed. Out in the lake was a bobbing
buoy with a bulls-eye target upon it, and a
group of khaki-clad rookies were pelting this
with rifle shot. In an open part of the field
several companies were drilling and the crisp
orders of their officer could be plainly heard
across the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Preparedness!&rdquo; shouted Roy,
throwing his hat in the air.</p>
<p>They had been a rather sober party of voyagers
during this last part of their trip and
Roy&rsquo;s accustomed spirit seemed to have gone
from him, but it came back now with a rush
and as usual it had a contagious effect on the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Uncle Sam!&rdquo; shouted Pee-wee,
grabbing the naval flag from the stern
and waving it frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look like scouts, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said
Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cracky,&rdquo; enthused Pee-wee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad we came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether!&rdquo; called Mr. Ellsworth, looking
over to the smaller boat. &ldquo;Hoop it up,
Tom! Hurrah for Preparedness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought of it first,&rdquo; called Connie.
&ldquo;Uncle Sam swiped it from us. Come on,
let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em our own call!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Be prepared! Be prepared! Be prepared!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>And so, shouting lustily the motto of the
scouts the boats came alongside the landing
and were met by several smiling rookies, off
duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we pinched?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ellsworth,
laughing as he stepped ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; you&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; said a
bronzed rookie.</p>
<p>Pee-wee was not to be repressed by any
formal greeting, however hospitable. He
stood upon the <i>Honor Scout&rsquo;s</i> cabin, waving
the naval flag in one hand and his scout hat
in the other, like some frantic, idiotic form of
semaphoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Uncle Sam!&rdquo; he shrieked,
hilariously. &ldquo;Hurrah for Preparedness!
Hurrah for Platts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short, gaping like an idiot.
The flag fell from his hand unheeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Look&mdash;look!</i>,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, the Germans?&rdquo; asked a rookie,
looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Look&mdash;look!</i>&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>They looked, and there, sitting astride a
piece of artillery not far from shore, his
legs dangling and a merry smile upon his face,
was the freckled scout!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>No sign of scratch or bruise was there
about him, and if he had been shot out of the
mouth of the cannon he was straddling he
could hardly have caused greater consternation.
Plattsburg, preparedness, Uncle Sam,
must be content with back seats, as this
freckled youngster descended nimbly from
the cannon and came smiling toward his
brother scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Aren&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;dead?</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; said the freckled
boy with a surprised laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t find many dead ones among
the scouts, I guess,&rdquo; said an officer, who had
come down to confirm the rookies&rsquo; welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you three fellows,&rdquo; said the
freckled scout. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember? I
was in that store in Albany&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we got lost,&rdquo; began Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhh,&rdquo; interrupted Artie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we thought you were dead,&rdquo; said
Tom, startled somewhat out of his usual composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead? No,&rdquo; laughed the boy. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
been dead for quite a while. What&rsquo;s the
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have&mdash;have you got anything the matter
with you?&rdquo; stammered Pee-wee, staring
blankly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a wart on my left thumb,&rdquo; said
the freckled scout, &ldquo;but that won&rsquo;t stop me
helping Uncle Sam if we have to scrap it out
with Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got anything else the matter
with you?&rdquo; Pee-wee asked imploringly.
&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re alive, you ought to have
<i>something</i> the matter with you&mdash;&mdash; Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The freckled scout began to laugh and
then came <i>his</i> surprise, for he broke off as
Garry came ashore, and grasped him by the
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Everson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of tripe!&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t live in Warrentown, do you? Down
near Edgevale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, when I&rsquo;m alive,&rdquo; laughed the
freckled scout. &ldquo;But these fellows seem to
think I ought to be dead. What&rsquo;s the idea,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what <i>are</i> you doing alive, I&rsquo;d like
to know,&rdquo; said Garry. &ldquo;Fellows, this is&mdash;Everett,
I think your name is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warren Everett,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I recognized you,&rdquo; said Garry.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get a good enough squint at you
down the lake yesterday&mdash;if that <i>was</i> you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was me&mdash;I saw you fellows out
there in the boats. I see I&rsquo;ve got you all
guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the other fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s knocking around somewhere in
camp here. We just canoed up for a squint
at the place. I&rsquo;ve often seen you in Warrentown,&rdquo;
he added, turning again to Garry. &ldquo;I
heard you fellows over in Edgevale started a
troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fizzled out,&rdquo; said Garry, resting his
arm on Raymond&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the
last of our race. But, for goodness&rsquo; sakes, tell
us how you come to be alive, anyway? We
saw you fall down that cliff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warren Everett laughed again. &ldquo;You see
it was this way,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;On our way up
the Hudson we ran into a moving picture
bunch. They had a big launch and a hydro-aeroplane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They said we were just the fellows they
wanted because there was a scene they were
going to make where a scout climbs up a steep
mountain and then slips and falls down. They
wanted to take pictures of him climbing and
then more of him falling. They had the hill
all picked out and they wanted to know if
I&rsquo;d climb it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Believe me, that&rsquo;s my middle name,&rsquo; I
told them. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see the hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t got it with us,&rsquo; the man said,
&lsquo;but it&rsquo;s a peach, all right&mdash;it looks harder
than it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him about the falling down part,
and he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that.
We&rsquo;ve got a rag dummy to do the falling.
All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to climb till you get
to the grove near the top and when you get
inside of that you&rsquo;ll find the rag dummy on a
log. Just push it over and let it fall down
the hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;be&mdash;jiggered!&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea?&rdquo; laughed Everett. &ldquo;Of
course, the rag dummy went all the way down
to the bottom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it did,&rdquo; said Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the picture it won&rsquo;t be that way.
You&rsquo;ll see me climb up the hill and you&rsquo;ll see
the dummy start down, and then&mdash;zip, goes
the fillum&mdash;and the next you see is a first-aid
scout bandaging up another scout&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>By this time Everett&rsquo;s companions had
joined the party and having properly presented
him to the newcomers, the freckled boy
resumed his original seat astride the cannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we were down near
Glens Falls when we picked up the movie
men. They had a hydro and a big cabin boat.
They gave us the money for a uniform for the
rag dummy and we went back to Albany and
bought it. When we got back they were waiting
for us, and believe me, we had some fun
dressing up that dummy. I took the new suit
and gave him the old one. <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should worry,&rdquo; put in Roy.</p>
<p>The freckled scout continued his story,
swinging his legs and greatly delighted at the
astonishment of his listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a most remarkable thing,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ellsworth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it! Well, we all started
north with our canoe tagging behind. It was
all right, wasn&rsquo;t it, Frank, because we were
going that way anyway. When we got into
the lake the man in the hydro left the water
and said he&rsquo;d meet us on the top of the cliff.
He told me just where he&rsquo;d leave the dummy.
Oh, gee, but he looked nice as he went sailing
up in the air! We got out of the boat at
Westport<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
and Frank and I helped them lug
the camera and things to the mountain. We
had it all fixed just what we&rsquo;d do and when
the man found a good place up the hill a
ways, where they could get enough sunlight
on the only original Boy Scout movie star&mdash;that&rsquo;s
me!&mdash;Frank and I went back to Westport,
and paddled up in our canoe, just as if
we were coming to the mountain for the first
time. We got out under the cliff and I
started up. Frank stayed down below so he
could get the dummy! Believe me, that dummy
has some busy life! They use it for a
policeman and a soldier and a poor orphan
child&mdash;gee, you ought to see the clothes that
poor dummy&rsquo;s got!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you fellows know the rest.
I got to the top all right, and take it from me,
when I got my fists on that rag dummy, I gave
it one&mdash;good&mdash;chuck&mdash;<i>ker-bang!</i> G-o-o-d-night!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I trotted over to the big field on top
of the cliff where the fellow with the aeroplane
was waiting. Pretty soon along came
Frank dragging the poor dummy after him by
the leg. He came up the easy way. And
goodnight, Mary Ann! I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t
that poor dummy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
dryly, thinking of the harrowing hours
they had spent searching for his dead body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they said they had the picture all
right and it would be a beaut&rsquo;. So then the
man told us to jump in the aero and he&rsquo;d
bring us up to Plattsburg. You see that red
boat over there with <i>Back to Nature Film
Corporation</i> on it? That&rsquo;s ours&mdash;I mean,
theirs. They&rsquo;re going to take some pictures
here if they can get permission. But we&rsquo;re
out of the movie business for good&mdash;aren&rsquo;t
we, Frank? And we&rsquo;re going to ship our
little old canoe down home and get the train
tonight&mdash;&mdash; Hey, Everson,&rdquo; he said, breaking
off suddenly and turning to Garry; &ldquo;why in
the deuce don&rsquo;t you be a good scout and come
over to Warrentown and give us poor fellows
a hand? Mr. Wentworth, our scoutmaster,
is on the Mexican border and three of our
fellows have gone out west to live&mdash;the Harris
boys&mdash;maybe you know of them. Gee, a fellow
like you could help us an awful lot. You
could be a sort of scoutmaster till the Local
Council scares one up. And you don&rsquo;t live so
far&mdash;going scout pace. What do you say?
Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p><i>Would he!</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;He will on one condition,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.
&ldquo;You and your friend must join us
on our homeward cruise. I&rsquo;ve heard of the
Warrentown Troop and Garry ought to be
glad to get into it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be glad to get him!&rdquo; shouted
Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; put in Roy. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s
their chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think myself it will be an honor
both ways,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, who had
grown very fond of Garry. &ldquo;He will bring
you the Silver Cross&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s no rag dummy,&rdquo; interrupted
Roy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our plan,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, &ldquo;is to
look about the camp here and set off again
in the morning, for time is beginning to be
precious. We shall leave Raymond at
Temple Camp, in the Catskills, where he&rsquo;s
to stay for the balance of the summer. Then,
if you like, we&rsquo;ll drop you boys and Garry
at Edgevale. Our larger boat and one of our
members, to whom it belongs, we shall leave
at Nyack. The rest of us live in Bridgeboro,
New Jersey&mdash;we&rsquo;re the First Bridgeboro
B. S. A. Probably some of our boys will hike
it home from Nyack while the rest of us cruise
down into New York Bay and up our own
small river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a one-patrol river,&rdquo; said Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you with us?&rdquo; Connie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;s with us!&rdquo; cried Roy. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
deciding this, Warrentown or Bridgeboro?
We&rsquo;ll drag both of them along by the legs
the way they dragged the rag scout, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The party made a pleasant stay at the big
training camp, walking through the straight,
neat avenues of tents, visiting the commissary,
watching the drill, and lingering, fascinated,
about the rookies who were busy at rifle practice.
They were made very welcome and it
was not without a feeling of regret that they
went aboard the two boats after the colors had
been lowered. But Plattsburg, of which
they were to hear so much later, had been
merely the chosen point of destination for
their rambling inland cruise, and as Mr. Ellsworth
had remarked, time was beginning to
be precious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>The hospitable Bridgeboro Troop, with its
strangely acquired new member and its several
guests, lolled upon the deck and cabin roof of
the <i>Honor Scout</i> that night, as the two boats
waited at their moorings for the dawn which
would mean their departure on the speedier
journey homeward.</p>
<p>As the moon rose over the wide bosom of
the great lake and flickered the waters with
its silvery brightness, Harry Stanton sat upon
the cabin locker, strumming his ukulele, and
those who were in the mood hummed the soft
airs while the others listened. Often whole
days would elapse in which Harry Stanton
would be scarcely heard from, but in the quiet
of those summer nights upon the water he
contributed his full share to the pleasure of
the party.</p>
<p>If you, to whom I am about to bid a short
farewell, are a scout of the scouts, see to it
that some one of your troop&rsquo;s number learns to
play a mandolin, a banjo, or guitar&mdash;even if
you have to drag him by the leg, as young
Frank dragged the unfortunate dummy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>After a little while some one discovered
that Roy was not among them, and there was
set up at once a hue and cry for him, for such
an evening could be no more complete without
Roy than a Buffalo Bill Show would be without
Buffalo Bill or a circus without peanuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s in the other boat,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s on shore,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>It was Pee-wee who dragged him forth
from the forward end of the cabin, where he
had been ensconced, knees up, &ldquo;far from the
madding crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Artie Van
Arlen.</p>
<p>Roy squatted in his customary attitude,
holding a paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about all the crazy things
that have happened,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the fellows
we&rsquo;ve met on this trip, and believe <i>me</i>, it&rsquo;s
some hodge-podge. I was coming down from
that big commissary tent, scout pace, when
some poetry jumped into my noddle. Did you
ever notice how poetry comes to you when you
go scout pace?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Mr.
Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did,&rdquo; said the scoutmaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want to hear it? It&rsquo;s a sort of&mdash;sort of
a national anthem of the troop&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troop anthem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fixed up yet because the kid interrupted
me. Do you want to hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say I can stand it if the others can,&rdquo;
said the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, shoot!&rdquo; said Doc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the agony over with,&rdquo; said Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, since you insist,&rdquo; said Roy, taking
Tom&rsquo;s flashlight so he could read the immortal
lines. &ldquo;Here goes&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;<i>three</i>!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rag scouts, wooden scouts,</p>
<p class="t">Thin heads and thick,</p>
<p class="t0">Honor scouts, young sprouts&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">

<p class="t">Something-or-other&mdash;welk,</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of, it&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; yelled Pee-wee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s superb,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth,
&ldquo;especially the complimentary reference to
the scoutmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pleasure is mine,&rdquo; said Roy, with an
elaborate bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may I ask what a <i>pote</i> is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, a pote&rsquo;s a scout that writes pomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And a welk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; said Roy, undaunted.
&ldquo;The welkin is the sky, and welk&rsquo;s
short for welkin. Get me? I was just trying
to dope out how to fit that in when Pee-wee
grabbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to make you poet laureate
of the troop,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bridgeboro Bard,&rdquo; laughed Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think if I sent it to <i>Boys&rsquo; Life</i>
they&rsquo;d print it?&rdquo; Roy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, they would!&rdquo; yelled Pee-wee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellsworth, cautiously.
&ldquo;I doubt it. You might try. They
have printed worse things,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Roy glanced again at his masterpiece,
folded it up, put it in his pocket, drew his
knees up, clasped his hands about them, and
grinned at the assemblage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should worry,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let your boy grow up with Tom Slade,&rdquo; is a suggestion
which thousands of parents have followed during the past,
with the result that the TOM SLADE BOOKS are the
most popular boys&rsquo; books published today. They take Tom
Slade through a series of typical boy adventures through
his tenderfoot days as a scout, through his gallant days as
an American doughboy in France, back to his old patrol
and the old camp ground at Black Lake, and so on.</p>

<p>In the character and adventures of Roy Blakeley are typified
the very essence of Boy life. He is a real boy, as real as
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. He is the moving spirit of
the troop of Scouts of which he is a member, and the average
boy has to go only a little way in the first book before
Roy is the best friend he ever had, and he is willing to part
with his best treasure to get the next book in the series.</p>

<p>All readers of the Tom Slade and the Roy Blakeley
books are acquainted with Pee-wee Harris.
These stories record the true facts concerning his
size (what there is of it) and his heroism (such as it
is), his voice, his clothes, his appetite, his friends, his
enemies, his victims. Together with the thrilling narrative
of how he foiled, baffled, circumvented and
triumphed over everything and everybody (except
where he failed) and how even when he failed he
succeeded. The whole recorded in a series of screams
and told with neither muffler nor cut-out.</p>
